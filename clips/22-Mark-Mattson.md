Mark Mattson - Optimization of Cognitive Performance
<https://youtu.be/ZpcVku45hFY>
```
thanks for the introduction and like to
00:14
thank Ken for the invitation I met
00:17
Canada meeting and Wyoming Jackson Hole
00:21
aimed at trying to come up with new
00:24
ideas to improve cognitive performance
00:26
in particularly the military and people
00:29
who have to keep focused on a task for
00:32
extended time periods and one of the
00:34
approaches that might help as I'm going
00:38
to talk about today is intermittent
00:40
fasting or reducing energy intake or
00:44
eliminating energy intake for extended
00:47
time periods and I'm going to talk about
00:48
this from an evolutionary perspective
00:51
that is to say why it is that it makes
00:55
sense from an evolutionary perspective
00:57
and what the data are that your brain
01:00
should be working well when you're
01:01
hungry and haven't been able to obtain
01:03
food for a long period of time if your
01:06
brain isn't working well you're not
01:08
going to be able to compete with your
01:10
competitors to obtain the food and I'm
01:12
going to talk mostly about work we've
01:14
done in animals where we can tightly
01:16
control their food intake their eating
01:19
pattern their level of exercise and we
01:22
can directly look at their brain look at
01:25
individual nerve cells in their brains
01:26
put electrodes in those nerve cells
01:29
study communication between the nerve
01:31
cells take out the brain tissue measure
01:34
levels of various neural chemicals to
01:37
try to understand why it might be that
01:40
fasting and exercise are good for the
01:43
brain and then I'm going to talk a
01:46
little bit about some of the
01:47
translational work we've done asking a
01:51
couple simple questions in human
01:52
subjects can human subjects maintain
01:55
intermittent fasting diets long term and
01:58
if so does it improve their health and
02:00
then hopefully if I don't forget about
02:02
it at the end I'm going to mention a
02:05
study a study we have ongoing where
02:07
we're focusing on the brain okay
02:15
there we go
02:17
okay evolutionary perspective you don't
02:21
see many fad predator or prey in the
02:27
wild okay and so if you're a hungry
02:31
Bobcat and you haven't been able to
02:33
catch a rabbit in a long time you better
02:35
figure out how to track down the rabbit
02:39
and catch it and moreover you better be
02:41
physically fit and be able to catch it
02:43
on the other hand if you're the prey
02:45
likewise you better figure out how to
02:49
avoid the predator so the it just makes
02:53
sense intuitively that the brain has to
02:55
be functioning well and you have to be
02:56
physically fit for maximum performance
02:59
to survive at least in the case of
03:04
animals in the wild and probably in the
03:06
case of our human ancestors before the
03:11
Agricultural Revolution okay here's
03:14
another example we have an eagle
03:17
swooping down to get a fish and so in
03:20
addition to have being able to recognize
03:24
visually and detect the the prey they
03:28
have to have a good idea where to look
03:30
and and what kind of patterns of
03:33
rippling in the water represents a fish
03:37
versus some some other disturbance in
03:40
the water then also it's important
03:45
social interactions are very important
03:48
in survival among many species you know
03:51
we see some wolves here surrounding a
03:54
buffalo so they had to found that they
03:57
work together they could kill an animal
04:00
that an individual wouldn't be able to
04:02
kill by itself you know so this is a
04:05
example of the evolutionary basis of
04:08
social interactions but again all
04:10
revolving around figuring out how to
04:13
obtain food this is a major force for
04:18
evolution of the brain many organisms
04:21
including humans
04:24
okay our our boreal non-human primate
04:29
ancestors so before we came the we
04:32
became bipedal that our ancestors lived
04:39
in the canopy and they had to learn
04:42
where sources of the food are and I'm
04:44
going to come back to this point in the
04:47
end because it's kind of interesting
04:49
from an evolutionary perspective so
04:51
these primates had to know where tree
04:55
fruit trees were they also had to know
04:57
at what times of the year different
04:59
trees the fruits were ripened and
05:02
there's even evidence that this ability
05:06
a good ability to know when and where to
05:09
find these sources of food was a driving
05:11
force for evolution of what's called the
05:13
prefrontal cortex which is an area of
05:17
the brain that has expanded most in our
05:20
primate ancestors and in humans and it's
05:23
a brain region and evolved in what's
05:26
called executive function and
05:27
decision-making which humans do really
05:31
well in fact there's there's whole books
05:34
written on on the evidence supporting
05:38
this notion that our non-human primate
05:40
ancestors the reason their prefrontal
05:43
cortex started to develop was these it's
05:47
being able to make decisions on how to
05:49
obtain food and with limited resources
05:52
so then we can go even to how am I going
05:56
to spend much time on this slide but you
05:58
know I could even make the case that
06:01
development of tools was primarily early
06:03
on devoted to making tools that enabled
06:06
us to get food and compete to get food
06:09
bow-and-arrow you know a complex weapon
06:14
for hunting now we have guns and we we
06:18
use guns not only to obtain food but
06:20
unfortunately for more nefarious
06:22
purposes a mass collection of food right
06:30
mass production of food which is good
06:33
and bad it's good and it makes it easy
06:36
to get a lot of food nobody
06:38
starves bad and because you have the big
06:42
Agri and refining making corn syrup and
06:46
people have constant access to high
06:49
energy high energy density food they
06:52
don't have to work for their food they
06:54
don't have to challenge themselves to
06:56
get food either physically or mentally
06:58
and we think this is not good for the
07:01
brain in the long run it's better to to
07:05
challenge yourself physically and and
07:08
maybe by fasting which will activate
07:11
mechanisms in the brain that I talk
07:13
they'll talk about now which seem to be
07:16
good for learning and memory and and we
07:18
think may reduce the risk for developing
07:20
age-related neural degenerative
07:22
disorders such as Alzheimer's and
07:24
Parkinson's diseases okay you know
07:29
processed foods okay so this is this
07:32
quick summary this you know the point
07:37
here being that in the past animals and
07:40
our non-human primate ancestors and even
07:43
hunter-gatherers humans had to work for
07:46
their food and had to go extended time
07:49
periods without food based on the
07:51
seasons and other aspects of drought
07:55
you know weather and so on and as you
07:59
know the major killers in humans a
08:01
hundred years ago were infectious
08:04
diseases actually injuries and
08:07
cardiovascular disease and diabetes were
08:11
very rare back then and now with the
08:15
processed food industries and our and
08:18
technological advances that allow us to
08:21
to go our whole life earn a living
08:25
without expending any energy you go to
08:28
your car drive to work take the elevator
08:32
sit down all day come back and and with
08:36
ready access to food but now the you
08:40
know major killers are cardiovascular
08:41
disease cancers diabetes much of this
08:44
driven by the couch potato lifestyle
08:50
what I would also point out here that
08:53
and I guess I didn't put this slide in
08:55
with advances in research in the areas
08:59
of cancer cardiovascular disease and
09:01
diabetes so for example early detection
09:04
of some cancers colon cancer is a good
09:06
example and where you can detect it
09:10
early get rid of it before it kills you
09:13
and and treatments for cancers and then
09:16
cardiovascular disease people who would
09:19
have died in their 50s 80 years ago and
09:23
now getting bypass surgery living
09:26
another 20-30 years same with diabetes
09:30
there's some effective treatments
09:31
although none of them are as effective
09:33
as exercise and reducing energy intake
09:36
so many people who would have died when
09:38
they're in their 50s and 60s are now
09:40
living into their 70s and 80s which is
09:43
the danger zone for Alzheimer's and
09:46
Parkinson's disease in terms of age and
09:49
unfortunately there are none zero
09:52
treatments that are effective for
09:54
Alzheimer's in slowing the progression
09:56
Parkinson's there are symptomatic
09:58
treatments early on in the disease but
10:02
invariably the the patients will have
10:04
progressive degeneration and die so this
10:07
is a huge problem not only from the
10:09
demographics of the baby boomers
10:11
reaching the danger zone for these brain
10:14
disorders of aging but also from the
10:17
fact that advances in and allowing
10:19
people who would previously have died at
10:22
earlier ages to live to these ages ok
10:26
this is a schematic diagram showing the
10:29
nerve cell circuitry of a brain region
10:31
called the hippocampus it's a brain
10:34
region critical for learning and memory
10:36
and the reason is because it receives
10:38
inputs from our different sensory inputs
10:43
vision hearing touch all of the sensory
10:47
information funnels in to the
10:49
hippocampus and so that since that's
10:52
where these inputs converge that's where
10:55
the pairing of a of an image and a sound
10:59
for example are paired temporally so
11:02
when you look at my slide and you
11:04
listen to my voice then that visual and
11:08
auditory information is converging and
11:10
what happens here in the hippocampus is
11:14
critical for the at least the short-term
11:17
memory of that so that you know 10 sec
11:21
20 seconds from now I can ask I can
11:25
change the slide and I can ask you
11:27
verbally what was on my previous slide
11:29
and you can give me a visual description
11:32
of what was on the slide and that's
11:35
because of this important brain region
11:39
the hippocampus this is a brain region
11:40
where nerve cells become dysfunctional
11:43
and degenerate in Alzheimer's disease
11:45
now it's been shown by other labs in our
11:49
lab that vigorous physical exercise like
11:54
running for example and dietary energy
11:56
restriction and also intellectual
12:00
challenges in doing what we're doing now
12:04
increase excitability of these nerve
12:07
cells in the hippocampus and what
12:09
happens is there's a neurotransmitter
12:12
represented by the red dots here I guess
12:17
called glutamate its amino and amino
12:19
acid but it's also the major excitatory
12:22
neurotransmitter in the brain so it's
12:24
released from an axon terminal it is
12:26
synapse and it activates receptors on
12:29
the subsequent cell in the circuit and
12:31
you get flow of information and also
12:35
with activity in these nerve cell
12:36
circuits this electrochemical activity
12:39
that stimulates production of a protein
12:42
called BDNF brain-derived neurotrophic
12:45
factor this neurotrophins levels
12:50
increase in response to exercise
12:52
intermittent fasting and and
12:55
intellectual challenges and it's been
12:59
shown in animal studies and also there's
13:01
some evidence I'll briefly show you one
13:03
slide from human studies that BDNF plays
13:06
very important role in learning and
13:07
memory so if you block BDNF production
13:10
or it's action that will impair
13:13
cognitive performance in animals and
13:16
there's also correlations between
13:18
enough levels and cognitive performance
13:20
in humans another interesting aspect of
13:23
this hippocampus is that there are stem
13:26
cells dividing cells that can replicate
13:30
and then when they get the right signal
13:32
such as exercise or fasting these cells
13:36
stop dividing and they form new nerve
13:40
cells which are then integrated into the
13:43
nerve cell circuits and one of the
13:45
investigators in my group Henriette von
13:48
Prague has shown that the production of
13:50
these new nerve cells in response to
13:53
exercise enhances a form of learning and
13:59
memory called spatial pattern separation
14:01
and I'll show you one or two slides on
14:04
some of those data and this becomes very
14:06
important in thinking about how exercise
14:09
might benefit human cognition even
14:12
higher cognitive functions such as
14:14
imagination and creativity in humans and
14:18
I should also point out you know this
14:19
intellectual enrichment this can be you
14:25
know thinking about complex problems
14:27
such as we're thinking about now are can
14:29
be music learning and playing music
14:32
recalling and and maybe improvising in
14:35
music so that's another type of
14:41
environmental input that seems to
14:44
activate these pathways that enhance
14:47
synaptic plasticity and promote the
14:49
production and integration of new nerve
14:51
cells ok I'm going to briefly talk about
14:55
exercise before I had talked about
14:57
intermittent fasting I'm dr. Bob Prague
15:00
Prague showed that if she puts running
15:05
wheels in the cages of mice and then MIT
15:09
and then identifies the number of stem
15:11
cells in the hippocampus each black dot
15:14
here is a stem cell I don't need to go
15:16
into the technical details of how we
15:18
label these stem cells she finds that
15:22
running increases the number of stem
15:24
cells and then when she follows over
15:27
time what happens to these stem cells
15:29
she finds that many of these
15:32
stem cells form new nerve cells so this
15:34
is an individual nerve cell with a cell
15:36
body here the dendrites here these
15:39
receive information coming into the
15:41
hippocampus and so yeah and so this is
15:48
this is my son here Elliot this is my
15:50
daughter M is the coach high school
15:53
cross country I quit doing that a number
15:55
of years ago actually after Emma
15:56
graduated and but I would tell the kids
15:59
on the team that you know this is really
16:02
good for your brain and we all the
16:05
parents you know so we'd have pasta
16:08
parties the day before the the meet and
16:11
it's kind of the carbo-loading type
16:14
thinking I'm not sure that's necessarily
16:16
right but anyway and but you know all
16:20
the parents including us we notice
16:22
during the cross-country season the kids
16:24
their mood is better exercise has an
16:27
antidepressant effect it improves mood
16:29
and we think that actually occurs
16:31
through increasing BDNF levels there's
16:34
good evidence for that in fact the most
16:36
commonly prescribed antidepressants
16:38
Prozac Paxil etc increased BDNF levels
16:42
in the brain and at least in animal
16:44
models if you if you block BDNF then
16:48
these antidepressants don't work but
16:51
also their grades are better in the
16:55
during the cross-country season okay so
17:01
now I'm going to go back to the study in
17:03
mice so one one way we can test
17:06
cognitive function in mice is using
17:09
touch screens so this is actually very
17:12
new only in the last five years or so
17:14
this started to become widely used so
17:19
first you can teach a mouse that if it
17:21
touches its nose to a touchscreen it
17:24
will get a food reward so these are
17:25
small boxes with a touchscreen and then
17:28
this like half a foot away from the
17:31
touchscreen a food reward bin and this
17:35
is all computerized then what we do is
17:37
we put one lid I con on the screen and
17:40
over a period of a couple weeks the
17:42
mouse will learn if it touches this icon
17:45
with its
17:45
knows it gets a food reward and then we
17:48
put two icons on the screen we teach it
17:50
train it to touch this one for a food
17:52
reward if it touches this one it doesn't
17:54
get a food reward then we decrease the
17:57
distance between the lid icons and as we
18:00
decrease the distance going from big to
18:03
small icons the mice make more errors
18:07
you know they have more trouble
18:09
distinguishing which one they should
18:12
touch because they're closer together so
18:14
we call that spatial pattern separation
18:16
ability and however if we put running
18:18
wheels in the cages of the animals here
18:23
they make fewer errors significantly
18:25
fewer errors as we decrease the distance
18:28
between these icons so running improves
18:31
the ability of the mice to distinguish
18:34
between these icons when they're close
18:36
distance and we found a correlation with
18:38
production of new neurons that is fewer
18:44
errors more new neurons ok I'm a trail
18:51
runner and from from an evolutionary
18:54
perspective a human evolution trail
18:58
running is the quintessential human
19:01
experience it's what our ancestors did a
19:04
lot of but walking or running on trails
19:07
and it become became very beneficial for
19:11
an and you know that the data suggests
19:14
that we lived in small groups tribes
19:16
hunter-gatherer tribe scenarios and so
19:19
is a big advantage for us when we're
19:22
running you know going some distance say
19:25
20 miles away from from the where the
19:29
tribe lived to be able to remember what
19:31
we encountered we when we went on that
19:34
trail run or walk so that when and and I
19:37
think this was actually a driving force
19:38
for development of language or at least
19:40
one driving force because it's obviously
19:43
a value to transmit the information on
19:46
what you saw and encountered to your
19:49
tribe mates so that then you know they
19:53
can go out and you can tell them to you
19:56
go on the blue trail you go on let's see
19:59
where do we go so our running group we
20:01
have a running group Saturday mornings
20:03
we go trail running so for example we'll
20:05
say ok we're going to take the yellow
20:07
trail to the blue trail and then we're
20:09
going to come back or we're going to go
20:11
this route or the other and after a few
20:14
runs on the trail not only do you
20:15
remember that general route you remember
20:17
details of where individual rocks rocks
20:22
and roots are and what's coming up you
20:25
know there's a big hill coming up so
20:27
maybe I should back off now because I
20:30
don't want to be dead at the end of that
20:32
but from the standpoint of cognitive
20:34
function if you're if you have to be
20:37
focusing on what you're doing while
20:39
you're exercising I think that promotes
20:42
optimal brain function in the long run
20:46
no pun intended
20:49
ok so let's go back to animal studies
20:52
diabetes is a big problem now and no pun
20:56
intended again but you know being
20:58
overweight is a big risk factor for
21:00
diabetes so we have animal models of
21:02
diabetes one model is leptin receptor
21:06
mutant mice leptin is a hormone when you
21:09
eat a meal its released from fat cells
21:13
and and into your blood and it travels
21:16
to your brain and it tells you to stop
21:19
eating you're getting full so people
21:24
obese people often have what's called
21:26
leptin resistance and actually have high
21:29
levels of leptin so they produce the
21:32
leptin but the leptin is not effective
21:35
in telling the brain to stop eating so
21:37
they continue to have the perception
21:41
that they're hungry even though they're
21:43
clearly not in danger of starving but
21:47
they you know so this is a and there's
21:49
also another problem with diabetes which
21:52
is well understood it's called insulin
21:55
resistance so individuals with type 2
21:57
diabetes often have elevated insulin
22:00
levels and the reason is because for
22:04
example the muscle and liver cells that
22:06
normally respond to insulin by taking up
22:10
glucose from the blood and moving it
22:12
into the muscle
22:12
or storing it in the liver those cells
22:15
don't respond to insulin properly and so
22:18
your pancreas starts putting out more
22:19
insulin to try to get the glucose out of
22:23
the blood okay so anyway we have mice
22:27
that can't respond to leptin and so they
22:31
have constant hunger essentially and
22:34
they overeat they become obese and
22:37
diabetic and so what we did is we looked
22:40
at these neurons in the hippocampus and
22:43
we looked at individual dendrites these
22:46
regions that receive information coming
22:49
into the hippocampus and so this is one
22:52
dendrite here and along this dendrite
22:55
you'll see these perpendicular
22:56
projections in each of these
22:58
perpendicular projections which are
23:00
called spines represent one synapse and
23:03
then we simply count the numbers of
23:06
these synapses and we quantify this and
23:09
so in this experiment what we had is
23:11
four groups of diabetic mice and four
23:14
groups of normal mice we call them
23:16
wild-type mice one condition was the
23:19
normal laboratory housing conditions ad
23:22
libitum fed they can eat whenever they
23:24
want eat as much as they want and
23:26
sedentary know these small cages no
23:31
running wheel then we had a group they
23:33
were fed ad libitum
23:34
but had running wheels in the cages we
23:37
had another group we reduced their cow
23:39
daily calorie intake by about 30% but
23:42
they were sedentary and then finally we
23:44
had a group that was calorie stricted
23:46
and they had running wheels in their
23:48
cages and if we look at the normal mice
23:50
here you see that the black bars calorie
23:54
restricted group had increased number of
23:56
synapses the animals with running wheels
24:01
in their cages had increased number of
24:04
synapses compared to the couch potato
24:06
mice and then the combination of calorie
24:10
restriction and running had the maximal
24:12
effect in increasing in the number of
24:14
synapses and in fact these animals do
24:17
the best in learning and memory tasks
24:19
then we look at the diabetic mice here
24:21
you see overall they have much lower
24:24
number of synapses than
24:26
to the normal mice however nevertheless
24:29
both calorie restriction and running
24:32
increased approximately doubled the
24:35
number of synapses and this isn't
24:37
immediately this occurred over three to
24:40
four month time period and then finally
24:44
in this lower panel we see a nice
24:45
correlation between synapses and BDNF
24:49
levels so calorie striction and running
24:52
increased BDNF levels the combination
24:55
you get a further boost in BDNF levels
24:57
and we think BDNF is playing a role in
25:00
the improved learning and memory what
25:03
about humans well it turns out there are
25:07
certain families that have reduced
25:11
levels of BDNF levels because they have
25:14
a mutation that they in hitting the gene
25:17
encoding BDNF that they inherited from
25:19
one of their parents so these are B D
25:24
and F heterozygous humans and then if
25:29
you compare and in this study was done
25:31
in young adults so high school kids
25:35
either kids normal kids or kids with
25:38
reduced BDNF levels and this is testing
25:41
their cognitive functioning so there's a
25:43
statistically significant were poor
25:48
performance of the kids with reduced
25:52
BDNF levels compared to the normal kids
25:54
and then this study was done recently
25:56
published in 2013 autism is a very big
26:00
issue and problem now so they also
26:04
tested these kids for behaviors that are
26:09
characteristic of autism and the kids
26:12
with reduced BDNF levels had
26:14
significantly higher score on these
26:16
autism like behaviors compared to kids
26:19
with normal BDNF levels so these data
26:23
we're obtaining in mice isn't not just
26:26
relevant to my sweet ink it's very
26:28
relevant to humans okay I mentioned in
26:32
humans that we have a big prefrontal
26:34
cortex also to our other regions of the
26:38
brain that have expanded in
26:40
humans are those that are related to
26:42
language evil either indirectly or more
26:44
directly so visual cortex and associated
26:47
regions so language is central
26:49
essentially processing of visual and
26:52
auditory information and correlating
26:55
them you know you read something and
26:58
it's all recognizing patterns the
27:02
letters and their sequences and patterns
27:04
language audit you know speech is also
27:08
the same thing of case sequences of
27:12
sounds okay so I wrote this kind of a
27:18
provocative article if any of you are
27:20
interested you can access it easily on
27:23
the internet it's called superior
27:25
pattern processing is the essence of the
27:27
evolved human brain so I showed that
27:29
exercise and also intermittent fasting
27:32
can improve cognitive function and
27:35
spatial pattern separation and I think
27:38
even things like creation creativity
27:41
imagination being able to foresee events
27:47
that might scenarios that might happen
27:49
in the future in decision-making all
27:51
revolve around processing visual and
27:54
auditory patterns okay now that we're
27:59
going to talk about fasting and so I
28:04
gave a TED talk on this so if you're
28:06
interested you can find this on the
28:08
internet easily but from a historical
28:12
perspective there's many cases where you
28:14
can find famous people who claim that
28:18
they did their best thinking and work
28:20
when they were fasting so Plato for
28:23
example he found that he did his best
28:26
thinking in writing when he was fasting
28:28
so he subjected himself to sort of
28:31
intermittent fasting type scenarios
28:35
Gandhi and also you know many religions
28:38
fasting is commonly practiced and
28:41
because it clears the mind we think
28:44
that's actually true and from an
28:45
evolutionary perspective a non
28:48
religionist non-religious
28:53
true to evidence perspective fasting
28:58
should be good for the brain from the
28:59
standpoint of being able to compete to
29:03
obtain food and resources and now
29:05
compete your competitors and but also a
29:08
lot of interesting quotes for example
29:11
Mark Twain little starvation can really
29:13
do more for the average sick man than
29:15
the best medicines and best doctors and
29:19
so on also very interesting Upton
29:23
Sinclair who wrote the book the jungle
29:25
that exposed problems in the meatpacking
29:27
industry around turn-of-the-century 1900
29:31
he also wrote a book called the fasting
29:33
here and published it in 1911 very
29:37
interesting they interviewed 200 and
29:40
some people who had some ailment they
29:42
went on some fasting diet of various
29:46
types and and almost uniformly found
29:50
benefits for their health you can find
29:53
the full text of that on the internet -
29:56
okay in the 1990s we we were working on
30:03
trying to understand what's going wrong
30:04
in the brain in Alzheimer's disease
30:06
Parkinson's disease mainly in animal
30:09
models and we either used models that
30:13
are based on putting a mutated human
30:17
gene that causes Alzheimer's disease for
30:20
example mutation in the amyloid
30:22
precursor protein gene a mutated gene
30:25
that causes inherited Parkinson's
30:28
disease for example mutation in a gene
30:30
encoding the protein alpha-synuclein we
30:34
put those genes into the genome of mice
30:36
and those mice the Alzheimer's model
30:39
they'll get accumulation of amyloid in
30:41
their brains as they get older and
30:44
they'll have cognitive dysfunction the
30:47
Parkinson's model the mice will develop
30:49
accumulation of this alpha synuclein
30:51
protein in their dopaminergic neurons
30:54
and other neurons and they'll develop
30:56
motor dysfunction and actually die and
30:58
then we also had neuro toxin based
31:02
models where we administer
31:05
a toxin to the animals that selectively
31:08
damages nerve cells in the brain regions
31:11
in which the nerve cells degenerate in
31:14
the human disease so for example in this
31:17
one of the first papers we published on
31:21
intermittent fasting we use toxin based
31:25
models of severe epileptic seizures and
31:27
and kind of an acute amnesia and and
31:31
then a model of Huntington's disease
31:33
it's based on using a toxin that impairs
31:37
the mitochondrial function in nerve
31:38
cells so what we do in these experiments
31:42
is very simple in design we have two
31:44
groups of rats or mice one group there
31:47
they eat every day as much as they want
31:50
the other group we have them fast
31:53
every other day so one day we go in we
31:56
remove the food from the cage the next
31:59
day we go in at the same time we put
32:01
food back next day remove it next day
32:03
put it back so they go 24 hours no food
32:06
24 hours food that's the way they go for
32:10
months and months and then we expose
32:12
them to a toxin or are we we follow the
32:15
outcome as the disease develops in the
32:17
genetic models we test their learning in
32:21
memory we test their motor function and
32:23
so on and so for example in this study
32:26
we found that this intermittent fasting
32:29
alternate day fasting is neuroprotective
32:31
and improves functional outcome in
32:33
mouths of severe epileptic seizures and
32:36
Huntington's disease this is a different
32:39
model of Huntington's disease where we
32:41
have mice that express the mutated human
32:43
Huntington's gene this is a model of
32:48
Alzheimer's disease here that we
32:49
developed about 13 years ago these mice
32:56
develop amyloid accumulation and
32:58
cognitive dysfunction interestingly we
33:00
found that the intermittent fasting
33:04
prevented the cognitive impairment as
33:06
these animals get a lot older but it
33:09
didn't prevent the accumulation of the
33:12
amyloid so somehow and and we think we
33:15
know in part how the intermittent
33:18
fasting is protect
33:19
being the neurons against the amyloid
33:21
and that's very interesting because it
33:23
turns out that there are many humans who
33:25
they live into their 80s 90s even a
33:29
hundred their sharpest attack but then
33:32
when you look at the brains at autopsy
33:34
they're loaded with amyloid so somehow
33:37
those individuals resist the their nerve
33:41
cells are resistant to the adverse
33:43
effects of the amyloid whereas in other
33:45
individuals the nerve cells are not
33:49
resistant and and we think in the case
33:52
of exercise and fasting we have some
33:54
insight into why and I'm going to show
33:56
you in the next slides some of that and
34:00
we also found for example if we animals
34:02
that have been maintained on
34:03
intermittent fasting diet they have a
34:06
better outcome
34:06
following experimental stroke there's
34:09
less brain damage when when we block off
34:13
the blood supply fewer neurons died in
34:16
the territory supplied by that mainly by
34:18
that blood vessel and they have improved
34:20
functional outcome okay so what what
34:25
might be the mechanisms whereby fasting
34:27
is good for the brain well we know one
34:30
major thing that happens from the
34:33
standpoint of energy metabolism is that
34:36
if you eat three meals a day plus snacks
34:39
every time you eat the energy goes in
34:41
your liver it's stored in the form of
34:43
glycogen and that's always tapped into
34:45
first the glycogen is metabolized and
34:48
released the glucose is released into
34:51
the blood so if you eat three meals a
34:53
day plus the snacks you never deplete
34:56
the glycogen stores in your liver
34:58
however if you go for example say 16
35:00
hours without eating
35:01
certainly by 24 you've completely
35:04
depleted the glycogen stores in your
35:06
liver then what happens is fats are
35:09
mobilized so fatty acids are released
35:11
from your fat cells they go into the
35:13
liver and they're metabolized to what
35:16
are called ketone bodies such as beta
35:19
hydroxy butyrate and acetoacetate and
35:23
and so then and and you can you know we
35:27
all know this you can survive for weeks
35:29
and many people a month not eating
35:32
anything
35:33
as long as you have water available and
35:36
don't become dehydrated and the reason
35:39
is that you're running if you will on
35:41
ketones okay and it turns out ketones
35:45
are an energy source for neurons similar
35:50
to glucose in that both glucose and
35:53
ketones can be converted in the nerve
35:55
cells to ATP adenosine triphosphate and
35:58
and ATP is what the molecular energy
36:04
substrate is that allows our muscle
36:07
cells or brain cells to work okay
36:12
ketones are good for brain cells not
36:14
only because they're an energy source
36:16
but we think they actually have
36:18
signaling functions they have it's a
36:20
signal that's coming from the blood to
36:23
the brain that's alerting you and in the
36:26
case of our animal studies the animals
36:28
to the fact that there's this shift in
36:31
energy metabolism which is an indicator
36:34
that you better start finding a new food
36:36
source because eventually you're going
36:40
to run out of fat stores too and then
36:42
you're in big trouble and we find it in
36:45
fact that ketones increase BDNF
36:47
production in in the brain and we think
36:50
that that's a ketones are one peripheral
36:53
signal that alerts the brain that had
36:57
better start working well okay so we did
37:02
all these studies and animals and then I
37:03
was through correspondence communicated
37:07
with a number of MDS who work with
37:10
mostly with overweight subjects for
37:14
example Jim Johnson works with asthma
37:17
patients so we did a study with him
37:19
where we took small study twelve asthma
37:21
patients they're overweight we put them
37:25
on a diet where every other day they
37:27
only 500 calories which is a kind of a
37:30
very severe change these are overweight
37:34
subjects who are normally eating three
37:36
meals every day and they're taking in
37:39
too much energy but ten of the twelve
37:42
subjects were able to go two months on
37:44
that diet
37:46
they lost weight as you can imagine they
37:49
their asthma symptoms improve their
37:51
airway resistance improved Jim Jonsin
37:54
sent us blood within about two weeks and
37:58
and and then particularly by a month
38:00
markers of oxidative stress and
38:02
inflammation in their blood were way
38:04
down and stayed down through two months
38:06
and so Jim wrote a book called the
38:10
alternate day diet based on that and
38:12
published it I just let let these people
38:17
publish the books because two reasons
38:19
they did a good job another reason I'm
38:22
working for you you pay my salary I
38:24
can't make any profit on publishing a
38:27
book I'm a US government employee and
38:30
then we did a study in collaboration
38:33
with dr. Michele Harvey at the
38:35
University of Manchester in England who
38:38
works with women at risk for breast
38:40
cancer because of their family history
38:43
and and they're also most of them are
38:46
overweight and so in that study there
38:49
was about a hundred women we divided
38:51
them into two diet groups one group they
38:53
reduced their daily calorie intake by
38:55
25% the other group we had them two days
38:59
a week and in this study was two
39:00
consecutive days although we don't think
39:03
they necessarily have to be consecutive
39:05
but on those two days they ate only 500
39:07
calories that's now called the 5:2 diet
39:10
or the the fast diet and so what we
39:15
found in and they stayed on these diets
39:17
for six months and we had good
39:19
compliance week not only were they
39:22
losing weights but we measured leptin
39:24
levels we measured ketone levels and we
39:28
took we took blood on the days they're
39:30
supposed to be doing only 500 calories
39:32
the other days so we we can tell from a
39:35
scientific standpoint where they're
39:36
following the diet both energy
39:39
restriction groups lost weight but the
39:42
women on the 5:2 diet lost more belly
39:44
fat and they had greater improvement in
39:48
insulin sensitivity and very likely the
39:52
reason is because on those two days
39:54
they're burning fat whereas the women
39:57
who are eating three meals and just
40:00
reducing by 25% calories each meal every
40:04
time they eat they replenish the
40:05
glycogen stores and they never shift to
40:07
burning fat so that led to this to the
40:10
BBC doing a documentary on this and this
40:16
michael mosley the producer for the BBC
40:19
he wrote this fast diet book and there's
40:21
been some copycat books and and michele
40:24
harvey wrote a book and then the other
40:26
diet that's become popularized as what's
40:29
called time restricted feeding so
40:32
instead of you know focusing on maybe
40:34
two days a week cut way back or eat no
40:38
food and but maintain hydration another
40:41
approach is every day limit the time
40:44
period you eat to say eight hours six or
40:48
eight hours it turns out most americans
40:51
actually they put something caloric in
40:53
their mouth when they get up and then
40:55
they'll eat several meals and then
40:57
they'll eat the snack in the evening so
41:00
the only time they're not putting
41:02
something caloric in their mouth and
41:03
therefore not replenishing their
41:06
glycogen stores and their liver is when
41:09
they're sleeping so the idea with this
41:12
time restricted feeding or 8 hour diet
41:14
is you limit your time window that you
41:16
consume food dude say eight hours or so
41:18
I personally kind of limit to about six
41:21
hours then I actually exercise after
41:24
having not eaten for 16 or 18 hours I
41:28
had to eat lunch today but anyway I
41:33
didn't eat breakfast I ate a modest
41:35
lunch can will attest to that not many
41:39
calories and oh I'm feeling faint
41:42
No
41:43
now but I'm you know so you can run on
41:47
ketones for quite a while okay but this
41:52
is a different the point here is that
41:54
from the standpoint of challenging
41:57
yourself by oh energetically from from a
42:00
you know short term fasting approach
42:02
there are a number of different ways
42:04
that people might think about
42:05
incorporating this type of approach into
42:08
their lifestyle based on you know their
42:11
work schedule and so on for me it's easy
42:13
to to get up go right to the lab start
42:17
working I drink a lot of tea with you
42:20
know seems and and then I don't eat
42:23
lunch then a workout mid-afternoon and I
42:26
find I'm fine I don't get hungry that
42:29
much once you get adapted to it and I
42:30
don't have any post prandial sleepiness
42:36
you know that you might get if you eat
42:38
lunch particularly if you eat carbs for
42:40
lunch I'm getting kind of long winded I
42:43
don't know how much time I have left oh
42:46
my gosh
42:47
okay keto ketones may be good for your
42:56
brain okay
42:59
so here's kind of a idea now what we're
43:04
finding and I'm not going to have time
43:05
to show you any data but if we look at
43:08
the nerve cells themselves what's
43:10
happening in the nerve cells with
43:12
exercise with energy restriction
43:15
particularly fasting and I'm going to
43:17
talk about this at the end hormetic
43:19
phytochemicals we think that
43:21
mitochondria function better and
43:23
actually we think there are more
43:26
mitochondria in your nerve cells if you
43:28
exercise regularly we find that that
43:32
exercise in BDNF will increase a process
43:35
called mitochondrial biogenesis it's the
43:37
the growth in division of mitochondria
43:40
so similar to what happens in your
43:42
muscle cells when you exercise regularly
43:44
you increase the number of mitochondria
43:46
in your muscle cells that make sense
43:48
then your muscle cells can they have
43:51
more energy ATP we think that's
43:53
happening in nerve cells with these
43:55
types of bioenergetic channel
43:57
is also very importantly we think that
44:00
these are these challenges are
44:03
stimulating a process called Auto Fei
44:05
Jie Auto Fei Jie means self eating but
44:09
essentially what happens is the cells
44:12
enhance their ability to remove damaged
44:15
molecules dysfunctional mitochondria so
44:19
they're clearing out the garbage okay
44:23
and then neural trophy cat factors
44:26
increase we found that DNA repair
44:28
ability increases and all together that
44:32
we think that may counteract the
44:35
accumulation of these proteins amyloid
44:37
beta peptide tau and so on that
44:38
accumulate in Alzheimer's and
44:40
Parkinson's I'm going to skip all this
44:43
essentially recently we showed through a
44:48
number of approaches that that if we
44:52
block the ability of nerve cells to
44:55
increase the number of mitochondria that
44:58
will block the ability of exercise in
45:01
BDNF and and and we think fasting to
45:03
increase the number of synapses so again
45:06
we're looking at these synapses here and
45:08
we find that if we block the ability of
45:12
neurons to produce more mitochondria we
45:15
block or decrease the number of synapses
45:17
that's mainly what that is I'm going to
45:23
skip this except to say that we
45:26
discovered that there's a protein in
45:28
mitochondria called sur 2 & 3 and
45:32
exercise and BDNF will increase the
45:36
production of this protein in the
45:38
mitochondria and this protein cirthree
45:42
makes the mitochondria more resistant to
45:46
stress more resistant to oxidative
45:49
stress that is free radicals more
45:51
resistant to bioenergetic stress okay so
45:58
in the last two minutes I want I wanted
46:01
to get back to this because this is very
46:03
interesting so I haven't mentioned a
46:06
word yet a word that without a lot of
46:09
interest in is called hormesis
46:11
and the idea here is that and this is
46:15
well-documented exposure of cells or
46:18
organisms to a mild stress can enhance
46:22
the ability of this the organism and the
46:26
cells in that organism to more severe
46:29
stress so the idea here is that low
46:31
levels of stress are good high levels of
46:33
stress can be bad that's even true with
46:37
exercise you can overdo it in exercising
46:40
you can overdo it in fasting you can
46:43
starve to death
46:44
that would be overdoing it there but
46:47
there but there's a there's a big
46:49
therapeutic window for fasting it's it's
46:52
pretty hard to to overdo it there but
46:55
from an evolutionary perspective we
46:59
there's a lot of interest in what is it
47:02
about fruits and vegetables it's good
47:03
for health and and for many decades they
47:06
convinced that dogma is that there are
47:09
chemicals in the fruits and vegetables
47:11
that scavenge and scavenge free radicals
47:14
antioxidants so you go to the health
47:16
food store the vitamin you'll see
47:19
antioxidant antioxidant antioxidant
47:22
that's encrypt the chemicals at least
47:27
some of the chemicals that are in fruits
47:28
and vegetables that are good for your
47:30
health are good for your health from an
47:34
evolutionary perspective because they
47:36
are toxins they are noxious the reason
47:41
that they're produced by the plants is
47:43
to prevent you from eating the plants
47:46
and that is why the healthiest plants
47:51
have them are the worst-tasting plants
47:54
and why your kids don't want to eat the
47:57
broccoli and the other bitter tasting
48:00
chemicals and so I we I wrote an article
48:04
for Scientific American that was
48:07
published last year in the July issue
48:09
and and so here's the points here I'll
48:12
just read this quickly plants don't have
48:15
the option of fleeing predators as a
48:17
consequence they developed an elaborate
48:19
set of chemical defenses to ward off
48:21
insects and other creatures they want to
48:24
make them into a meal
48:26
these toxins that plants produce are
48:29
consumed by us there's no question about
48:31
that and the exposure of these chemicals
48:36
caused the mild stress reaction and this
48:38
is hence ability of ourselves to resist
48:41
more stress so it was to our advantage
48:44
to be able to eat a variety of fruits
48:47
and vegetables that have a bit even
48:50
those that have a bitter taste because
48:52
they have nutrient value they have
48:54
calories they have other nutrients and
48:56
so we develop many defenses against
48:59
these chemicals one is they are have
49:03
come
49:03
they have very bitter taste and indeed
49:07
there are many plants that have toxins
49:10
that can kill us even in low doses okay
49:14
and we can overdose on some of the
49:18
chemicals that probably everyone in this
49:20
room commonly consume caffeine is a
49:24
toxin you can kill yourself overdose
49:28
with caffeine if you take pure caffeine
49:30
and put it on your tongue you don't want
49:33
to have any part of it you it's very
49:35
bitter tasting okay
49:39
the second defense after our tongue is
49:44
vomiting okay
49:47
the third defense which is very
49:50
interesting is enzymes in the liver
49:51
called cytochrome p450s that rapidly
49:55
metabolize or degrade these noxious
49:58
chemicals that are in the plants the
50:00
fruits and vegetables so one pass
50:02
through the liver most of these
50:03
chemicals are removed from the body so
50:06
they pass through our system once and
50:09
and many of them get into the brain so
50:11
our cells are exposed to them they
50:12
induce a mild stress in ourselves and
50:14
they're eliminated so it's a transient
50:17
stress so we get this ideal of hormesis
50:22
transgender row-level exposure to these
50:24
toxins is good and high doses can kill
50:29
us but we have many defenses that
50:30
prevent that from happening so the final
50:34
slide my talk so I talked about these
50:38
challenges
50:38
is what happens fast bioenergetic
50:40
challenges intellectual challenges
50:42
phytochemicals activate these pathways
50:45
clear out the garbage increased neural
50:47
trophic factors but recovery period is
50:50
very important so after fasting eating
50:54
is important because you have to get the
50:57
nutrients in the cells and protein
50:59
synthesis to allow growth of the cells
51:02
building of muscles of your body builder
51:04
you can build muscle with intermittent
51:07
fasting but you've obviously got to eat
51:09
but as long as you eat after fasting
51:12
it's good in fact might even be better
51:14
for bodybuilding that if you didn't do a
51:17
short-term fast before you workout after
51:21
exercising resting sleeping is very
51:23
important for the brain and other
51:24
particularly for the brain and we think
51:27
what's happening during these recovery
51:30
periods is that it's when protein
51:32
synthesis goes up that's actually when
51:34
the number of mitochondria is increase
51:37
the the stimulation the pathways
51:39
activated for the increase occurs with
51:42
the challenge but it's then during the
51:44
recovery period that you actually get
51:45
the growth formation of new synapses and
51:48
and then we think enhanced learning and
51:50
memory so these cycles of a challenge to
51:54
your system and then a recovery period
51:57
challenge recovery and I'm talking about
51:59
you know within the period of a day or
52:02
over a period of a several days
52:03
challenge recovery challenge recovery
52:05
the best example of exercise which is
52:08
very evident but we think it's also true
52:10
with with with the food restriction and
52:15
fasting and intellectual challenges
52:18
right you sleep is very important for
52:20
what we think consolidating what you've
52:23
learned during your waking periods into
52:26
long term memories so this is a my
52:30
laboratory actually a couple years ago
52:32
so these faces or many of the people who
52:34
did a lot of the original research I
52:37
talked about and this is since I quit
52:39
coaching cross-country now I NIH has an
52:42
annual relay race in Bethesda we're in
52:46
Baltimore so we never entered this race
52:48
until I quit coaching cross-country then
52:50
I started coaching
52:52
getting together teams at ni a and so
52:57
this is one of the teams and we've
52:59
actually there's typically ninety to a
53:01
hundred teams in the race and each leg
53:03
wears five runners in the race to have
53:07
to be female each leg is a little over
53:09
eight hundred meters and so we we what
53:12
we finished first
53:13
the first year we entered the last two
53:15
years we've finished second point there
53:19
is we we practice what we preach thank
53:22
you very much
53:24
that I'm okay thank you so much now we
53:31
have time for some questions and answers
53:32
any questions out there I will cut and
53:35
wait for the microphone and I'm bringing
53:36
it to you thank you so much for you talk
53:40
have you looked into or are there other
53:43
parts of the research that are looking
53:44
at what the effect on mental illnesses
53:46
would be that's an excellent question
53:51
this hasn't been looked at much yet
53:54
that's how you're talking about fasting
53:56
it in particular yeah well there's good
54:01
evidence that exercise is good for for
54:04
many psychiatric disorders certainly for
54:06
depression for anxiety disorders bipolar
54:09
disorder is mechanistically there's
54:13
quite a bit overlap with anxiety and
54:15
depression as I mentioned exercise
54:18
increases BDNF levels in the brain and
54:21
that has an antidepressant effect
54:23
intermittent fasting in animals from a
54:27
neurochemical standpoint there's a lot
54:29
of overlap of what's happening in the
54:31
brain with intermittent fasting and
54:33
exercise so there's some scientific
54:36
rationale to suggest that it's worth
54:40
pursuing controlled studies in human
54:43
patient populations to my knowledge
54:46
there have not been such studies done I
54:48
think it's a very good question very
54:50
important to do there's a question that
54:55
comes up what about anorexia nervosa
54:58
which is a psychic psychiatric disorder
55:01
and it
55:04
and so one question is well you know
55:08
this particular particularly affects
55:09
most heavily young girls and and women
55:13
and so the answer is we don't know you
55:19
know I think that would be a good study
55:22
actually have some subjects with
55:24
anorexia nervosa and and and you divide
55:28
them and try to change their eating
55:30
pattern and and maybe maybe they would
55:33
Mabel that actually maybe it's
55:36
counterintuitive but maybe it actually
55:37
actually increase their overall energy
55:39
take during the week if they if they do
55:44
some intermittent approach am but one
55:49
interesting thing there that's that's
55:51
very interesting we well from a new
55:53
evolutionary perspective obviously
55:55
anorexia nervosa is is not something
55:59
that would be selected for in evolution
56:03
okay and and I don't know if we go back
56:08
you know historically and I guess
56:11
there's no way we can know I don't know
56:13
how you could possibly know did anorexia
56:17
nervosa exist you know what when did
56:22
when did it first appear because
56:24
obviously it's going to be selected
56:25
against and these women of course they
56:29
stopped cycling you know so they're not
56:32
going to reproduce we did a study and I
56:35
don't want to I want to give more people
56:36
chance for questions but we can since
56:40
we're not having dinner tonight we can
56:43
that we can
56:44
we marching orders we can extend the
56:47
question-and-answer period for an hour I
56:50
don't think so I'm up for it I have to
56:52
vote no on that but go ahead but uh as
56:55
quickly as I can wait we did a study in
56:57
rats we had male and female rats and we
57:00
put them on either their normal diet you
57:03
know ad libitum we had groups with 20%
57:05
Daly reduction calorie 40% Daly
57:08
reduction calorie alternate day fasting
57:10
and we even had a McDonald's diet type
57:13
diet and then we let them go for six
57:15
months with the the severe calorie
57:18
restriction 40 percent daily reduction
57:20
in calories the the female mice aren't
57:25
rats female rats became essentially
57:28
emaciated I mean that they had zero
57:32
observable body fat when we ended up
57:34
killing them at six months the males and
57:37
they also became much more physically
57:41
active in their cage the males on the
57:44
other hand they they maintained lean
57:47
mass they even had some fat and they
57:49
were they didn't have an increase in
57:51
activity now from an evolutionary and
57:54
the females quit cycling their estrus
57:57
cycle completely stopped the males
57:59
remain fertile so from an evolutionary
58:02
perspective maybe that makes sense if if
58:05
you're a female and there's not much
58:07
food available you don't want to get
58:08
pregnant because there's no energy for
58:11
your offspring on the other hand if
58:14
you're a male you want to remain fertile
58:17
so you can pass your genes on before you
58:19
starve to death yeah so okay then
58:34
Thank You dr. Mattson for your research
58:36
in your lecture here if I understood you
58:38
correctly you were talking or you you
58:40
feel that there's evidence to indicate
58:42
that it is increased levels of ketones
58:46
such as beta hydroxy butyrate and acity
58:48
acetyl acetate that calls the increase
58:53
of being the BDNF levels if if that is
58:59
the case what are the implications for a
59:02
ketogenic diet and/or exogenous ketones
59:07
yeah that's a excellent question
59:11
with and this is a question we're trying
59:13
to address in a very clear-cut manner
59:17
experimentally which it turns out not to
59:19
be easy because I think I mentioned
59:23
early on that nerve cell network
59:25
activity in the brain is also increasing
59:27
during exercise and with fasting in fact
59:30
in the animals it's very obvious after
59:33
they fasted the day you go in and
59:34
they're like they're very active and you
59:37
can tell they're hungry and searching
59:39
for food and we know that activity in
59:41
neural circuits increases BDNF
59:43
production we also know however that
59:45
hydroxybutyrate
59:47
in even in cultured nerve cells we add
59:50
hydroxy butyrate BDNF levels go up so we
59:54
know that hydroxy butyrate can and we
59:57
know it gets in the brain easy we know
59:58
it can directly act on neurons so we
60:01
don't know what the relative
60:02
contributions are of the ketones versus
60:06
the intrinsic changes going on in the
60:09
brain now the way to experimentally
60:12
address that which we're trying to do
60:13
now is to selectively block the
60:17
production of ketones in the liver by
60:20
using a genetic tools to knock out the
60:23
gene that's critical for conversion of
60:26
the fatty acids to the ketones in the
60:28
liver so then then we can fast animals
60:32
or subject animals to exercise and not
60:36
get the increase in ketones
60:37
and then look at the brain
60:39
and that you know that's the only way we
60:43
can think of the way we can really
60:44
critically address that but as far as
60:48
not fast as far as eating three meals a
60:52
day not exercising at but supplementing
60:56
with ketones I think there will be some
60:59
benefit but it won't be as great as
61:03
exercise and fasting because exercise
61:06
and fasting have much more complex
61:10
integrated effects than any single
61:13
molecule can have all right we have time
61:16
for one last question I'm starving so
61:21
we'll have two more questions because oh
61:24
okay I have great conclusion Kai watch
61:27
your brain function
61:29
oh that's it see I'm looking out for
61:32
your own interest okay okay excuse me is
61:39
the production of BDNF and mitochondrial
61:42
replication was there more in aerobic or
61:47
anaerobic exercise or was there no
61:51
difference yeah that's an excellent
61:52
question we don't have a clear answer to
61:55
that we know it beeped enough does
61:58
increase with aerobic exercise and in
62:01
animals it's hard to study the you know
62:04
like weightlifting and my sir I read and
62:07
and well the other aspect of that in
62:11
humans was in animals we can take out
62:14
the brain tissue and directly measure
62:16
BDNF in humans we can measure BDNF in
62:19
the cerebrospinal fluid and the blood
62:21
but in the blood we're not sure where
62:25
the BDNF is coming from because it's
62:27
it's not produced just in the brain is
62:29
produced other places and so in humans
62:32
we we don't know yeah and and and and
62:36
rodents we actually don't know either so
62:38
we started a study now where we are we
62:43
have subjects this is an exercise but
62:47
we're doing intermittent fasting in
62:50
individuals between the ages of 55 and
62:52
70 who are
62:53
biess and have insulin resistance we're
62:55
going to have them in two groups either
62:57
intermittent fasting 5:2 diet or normal
62:59
diet we're doing cognitive testing
63:02
looking at functional Network activity
63:04
by functional MRI and we're also taking
63:06
cerebral spinal fluid at baseline and
63:09
after two months on the diets and we can
63:11
measure BDNF in the cerebrospinal fluid
63:14
and that will give us an answer from the
63:17
fasting standpoint great let's speak
63:20
let's thank our speaker one more time
```
