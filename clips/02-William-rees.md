William Rees: Post-doom with Michael Dowd and Connie Barlow
https://youtu.be/j__AW5pycaA


00:17
you mentioned the ecological footprint I
00:20
described it a little bit earlier it was
00:22
a metaphorical concept I had no idea
00:24
that it would become within a decade
00:27
probably the best-known indicator of
00:30
sustainability at least among people who
00:32
even begin to think that way
00:34
so then idea the idea that we are so
00:37
intimately connected to the ecosphere it
00:39
never occurred to most people it just
00:41
had to be births in language yes yes you
00:44
Adam said ecological footprint is just a
00:47
linguistic term but it captures so much
00:50
because people see an imprint it's on
00:53
the land and they make that little
00:55
connection
01:02
William Reece you have been somebody
01:04
that has been a an intellectual mentor
01:08
my most important intellectual mentor is
01:11
William our captain junior his book
01:13
overshoot was so foundational and you
01:15
are carrying that torch with your work
01:18
and the ecological footprint and just
01:20
everything that you do and so I just
01:22
welcome you to this series because this
01:23
post Noom conversation series is really
01:26
intended to be about having
01:27
conversations with people who get the
01:29
big picture and who understand our
01:31
predicament and why we are and the mess
01:33
we are and what's possible and what's
01:35
not really possible going forward and
01:37
yet also staying in a positive heart
01:40
space to make as big a contribution as
01:42
we can so thank you for being part of
01:44
this series I'm delighted to be here
01:46
thank you for that and I'm really
01:51
thrilled to be on here
01:53
because of your role in metaphors are so
01:57
important and applied population ecology
02:00
is so important so translating the
02:03
ecological notion of carrying capacity
02:05
into the ecological footprint I mean who
02:08
doesn't know about that and now it's
02:10
translated also into carbon footprint
02:12
it's so important and we're just a few
02:15
weeks before the 50th anniversary of
02:18
Earth Day and so it's a delight to have
02:21
you on and we're going to go through
02:23
your experience of the ecological
02:27
understandings and the public
02:29
understandings and resistances to
02:33
ecological carrying capacity and the
02:37
human footprint but before we go there
02:40
bill for people who are watching this or
02:42
who are listening to this who may not be
02:45
familiar with you they've never read
02:47
your stuff they never watched you listen
02:48
to anything help us just get you like in
02:51
a nutshell like a share and don't be
02:53
bashful but sure what's your best known
02:54
for what you're passionate about what
02:56
you've done career-wise so help the
02:58
uninitiated to know who you are I said
03:01
well I'm best known for the ecological
03:04
footprint concept but I've written about
03:06
everything from basic ecology to human
03:10
cognitive psychology and some of the
03:13
problem within
03:15
evolutionary development of the human
03:17
nervous system that are really hanging
03:19
is up but if we want to talk a bit about
03:22
the footprint I was extremely fortunate
03:26
and that I spent a good deal of my youth
03:29
growing up on the farm in southern
03:30
Ontario my grandparents farm and this is
03:34
in the 40s and 50s we didn't have a
03:36
tractor I have loaded hay by hand with a
03:41
pitchfork onto a horse-drawn wagon
03:43
so that really begins to date me the
03:46
point is we were completely
03:47
self-sufficient on that farm and I one
03:52
day was sitting in my grandmother's big
03:54
country porch just staring at my plate
03:57
which was heap with food we'd come in
03:59
from the fields we've been working all
04:00
morning we were waiting for my
04:02
grandfather to come in to say grace and
04:04
I have no idea what happened but as I
04:08
stared at that food I was suddenly
04:09
overwhelmed with this sense of
04:11
connection to the earth because it was
04:13
nothing I'm a ten-year-old kid nothing
04:16
on that plate that I hadn't had a hand
04:18
in growing and then I felt as if I was
04:22
falling as if on an elevator in freefall
04:25
of the way I have described it with that
04:27
realization of deep connection to
04:30
everything else we literally that's I
04:32
got this insert we are what we eat but
04:34
it was far beyond that in terms of our
04:37
connectivity to the planet and my whole
04:40
point in even repeating this little
04:42
story is it's an experience that urban
04:45
people today cannot have we're so
04:48
disconnected cities the whole process of
04:51
urbanization tends to disconnect people
04:54
both spatially and psychologically from
04:57
the natural systems of which we are a
04:59
part in which support and so even then
05:04
as a ten-year-old my life as an
05:07
ecologist began and it was recalling
05:10
that singular epiphany as a youth that
05:13
convinced me I had to study ecology in
05:16
university and took it all the way
05:19
through to doing my PhD in population
05:23
ecology now the human ecological
05:26
footprint also
05:28
origins to that farm experience because
05:30
even as a kid I wondered well just how
05:33
much of the farm isn't he did to support
05:36
just me because if I eat this many
05:38
carrots and that many apples and are
05:40
there you can actually work out a reason
05:43
the amount of the Earth's surface
05:44
dedicated to producing everything that I
05:47
consume whether it's my cotton shirt or
05:50
my wool pants or whatever it might be
05:51
everything that goes through the economy
05:54
behold throughput as we now call it has
05:57
a connection to the natural environment
05:59
I don't like the word environment
06:01
because it already separates us from
06:02
everything else but it does cactus to
06:05
nature so by the time I got through my
06:08
training and found myself employed by a
06:12
planning school because I wanted to work
06:13
on the human dimensions of this problem
06:16
it was obvious what I had to do and so I
06:19
began during early teaching or they then
06:21
called the regional something or other
06:24
can you remember the original name for
06:27
this thing but it was the idea that if
06:29
we could pull together all of the land
06:32
needed to support not only us as bodies
06:34
but the infrastructure of our
06:36
technologies and so on and so forth we
06:39
would have a fairly good idea of the
06:41
size of a micro planet that would be
06:43
necessary to support this city or this
06:45
region or this country and then clearly
06:47
the whole of the earth oddly I got a new
06:52
computer and this computer was a
06:55
vertical tower and I was completing my
06:59
very first published to be published
07:01
hadn't yet been published paper on this
07:03
concept that was developing and a
07:06
colleague came into my office and said
07:07
oh you've got your new computer the
07:09
department's gonna buy one for all of us
07:11
I was the first one who happened to get
07:13
one on my desk and I said yes and I'm
07:16
needed because it has such a small
07:18
footprint on my desk bingo I went back
07:22
into my paper and changed the
07:24
terminology for this regional capsule
07:26
concept into the ecological footprint
07:29
concept so there was a series of kind of
07:31
suits in that with serendipitous actions
07:34
that took place here to really give
07:37
birth to this idea going right back to
07:39
my farming my background all the way to
07:41
the
07:42
birth of the concept the the metaphor is
07:44
equal at the ecological footprint so
07:47
that's the origin of that particular
07:49
story and if Carter said it's been
07:51
compelled by some of the people that
07:53
you've already mentioned I mean I I was
07:56
blown away by Paul Ehrlich's book the
07:58
Population Bomb at that time limits to
08:01
growth was a huge controversial study
08:03
when I was first teaching at UBC in the
08:06
early 1970s Rachel Carson's the Silent
08:09
Spring affected me dramatically because
08:12
I happened that study bird populations
08:14
for my doctoral studies was deeply into
08:17
understanding the dynamics of burden
08:20
production and how in fact the sequence
08:23
which by the way was unknown to science
08:25
until we had to look find it by
08:28
hindsight this is so common in in our
08:32
ecological complexity that phenomena
08:36
that are emergent I'm referring here to
08:39
the thin shell syndrome that be
08:42
byproducts of DDT produced by acting as
08:45
a hormone mimic in birds so that they
08:48
were perfectly fertile normal mating
08:51
behavior took place but they would lay
08:53
eggs which had such thin shells that
08:56
when their parents roll them over to
08:58
maintain the options over the shells
09:01
would break and the eggs would therefore
09:03
never hatch and that thin shell syndrome
09:06
was caused by a hormone replacement
09:09
affecting the laying down parameter of
09:12
the calcium carbonate in the eggshells
09:14
and hence bingo but to find that out we
09:18
had to work backwards it was an unknown
09:21
physiological mechanism until it was
09:24
interfered with by these breakdown
09:26
products of the four major hydrocarbon
09:28
pesticides so I thought that was
09:30
brilliant but both as an illustration of
09:33
the complexity of systems and why we are
09:36
going to be hit repeatedly by phenomena
09:39
about which we have no understanding
09:40
until we discovered them by hindsight
09:43
and of course it was a great discovery
09:45
in and of itself and the fact that she
09:47
had warned us of the likelihood of these
09:49
kinds of phenomena was just a sheer
09:51
belief so she was a major influence but
09:54
there were many many many more
09:55
back to those yeah I have a question
09:58
about that as I calculate it since
10:02
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring was
10:04
published in 1962 you would have still
10:07
been an undergraduate college at that
10:09
time correct
10:10
I was yeah I read by I started my
10:14
doctorate in 1966
10:17
so I read her as oh yeah okay what was
10:21
that like for you and did you get scared
10:25
by in the United States so how she was
10:27
so harassed and and and mocked in some
10:33
ways for her science did that make you
10:35
want to be a scientist more or less Oh
10:39
much more look I had very naive
10:43
understanding of political dynamics but
10:46
clearly now what Rachel Carson went
10:50
through has been experienced by many
10:53
many innovators ever since anyone who
10:56
challenges the mainstream is going to be
10:59
in deep trouble one of the great
11:04
readings that I think everyone should
11:05
take a peek at is something called
11:07
the crowd a study of the popular mind by
11:11
Gustav Duvall I think it was published
11:13
in 1896 he was the first long line of I
11:18
suppose a cognitive psychologist who
11:21
studied the human mind particularly how
11:23
people behaved on mass and there's a
11:26
wonderful quote from that this is a bit
11:28
of a misquote but I'll try it out anyway
11:30
the masses have never sought after truth
11:33
they prefer error if error see visas
11:37
then whoever supplies them with error
11:41
will be their champion those who deny
11:45
their error will be despised something
11:49
like that his point was that once we've
11:51
adopted a particular worldview a way of
11:54
seeing anyone who challenges it is going
11:57
to be rejected so a Rachel Carson along
12:01
with many others has been rejected
12:03
denied kicked out because her views
12:07
simply went against the grain a chow
12:09
what was already beginning to emerge as
12:12
the growth dynamic you know we're stuck
12:14
in this this era of the assumption of
12:18
unlimited economic growth propelled by
12:20
continuous technological progress and it
12:23
only goes back that idea only goes back
12:25
to the 1950s
12:26
so Rachel Carson's book emerged within a
12:30
decade of the emergence of this new idea
12:33
that you can solve all of our problems
12:35
we broke of the economy so to have
12:38
someone who was a reasonably prominent
12:41
scientist stick her neck out and argue
12:43
against the proceeded wisdom in that
12:46
domain
12:47
you know pesticides are good they're
12:49
gonna stimulate agricultural production
12:52
and so on and so forth to take one
12:55
little bit of her work it was simply an
12:58
athlete but it was going on yeah yeah I
13:01
had first learned about Lebon from
13:03
either William cotton or William Ophuls
13:06
I can't remember which because those are
13:08
two of the sort of people that I've been
13:10
major teachers from my ecological
13:13
worldview in addition to your own work
13:15
yeah and and so moving on you mentioned
13:19
you started your PhD in 66 so where were
13:22
you for the first Earth Day 1970 and
13:26
what impact did that have on you in
13:29
terms of a sense of wow maybe the North
13:32
American public's are catching on to
13:35
this idea I honestly I'd be deceptive as
13:39
I said I remembered where it was on the
13:41
first Earth Day
13:42
I thought it was a great idea long
13:44
overdue but I can't say specifically I
13:47
suppose I was too engaged in my own
13:49
we're getting ready to head up north a
13:51
bit my fieldwork in the High Arctic
13:54
well actually the low Arctic competitor
13:57
but that's what if they occurred right
14:00
around that time and I was too busy with
14:02
my own work to get too engaged in it
14:05
what about limits to growth when that
14:08
came out in 72 did that you know get its
14:11
way through to you and your research
14:13
then or some how did you come upon it
14:15
later by 72 I was already teaching in
14:20
the school of community and regional
14:21
planning
14:22
at the University of British Columbia I
14:24
was charged there with developing the
14:27
first ever courses on human economic
14:29
illogical planning in any university in
14:32
North America so limits to growth came
14:35
out as an absolute gift to just about
14:38
everything that I was trying to teach in
14:41
that particular course the degree to
14:43
which it was received with her rejection
14:47
and disbelief by my colleagues in the
14:52
months in a year or two following the
14:54
publication of limits to growth it was
14:58
sunk as an effective idea by mostly
15:01
economists
15:02
who had completely adopted the growth
15:05
ethic the primary objection was that the
15:08
model was a primitive and we didn't take
15:10
into account human ingenuity at the time
15:14
human ingenuity was now regarded as the
15:17
greatest of resources so that with the
15:20
advance of technology we could overcome
15:22
any resistance to the growth of the
15:26
human enterprise population or the scale
15:29
of economic activity and of course this
15:32
is the kind of idea that people wanted
15:34
to believe it it reinforced this
15:37
confidence in our technological capacity
15:40
to move forward here again like Rachel
15:43
Carson was a book mr. growth that said
15:45
hey wait a minute if we continue down
15:47
this trail sometime in the 21st century
15:49
population will peak production will
15:52
peak out pollution peak out and the
15:54
whole thing is going to come tumbling
15:56
down Oh nobody wants to hear that
15:58
so just as gustave LaVon said we will
16:02
reject denied forget any contrary
16:05
visions to those which we hold dear and
16:08
receive with open arms those views and
16:12
people who support that which we already
16:15
believe by the way this is a good
16:16
cognitive reason for this we could get
16:18
in later but the point is limits the
16:21
growth was sunk from the day one largely
16:24
by the economics profession who simply
16:27
disregarded it as irrelevant a sidebar
16:31
even dangerous because it threatened to
16:33
halt the progress of
16:36
yeah I mean my interpretation of that is
16:38
that the Civic religion or the second
16:41
the religion of perpetual progress
16:43
driven by technology and human ingenuity
16:45
was so pervasive that it was a confront
16:49
to people's religious worldview that is
16:52
their their understanding of the nature
16:54
of reality and you know it's it's been
16:58
vindicated over time of course but yeah
17:02
well what about the next on the scene
17:05
would have been I mean we had on the
17:07
sixth major mass extinction with Norman
17:10
Myers and the concept of biodiversity
17:13
with you know Wilson and Michael Sewell
17:15
a starting you know the biodiversity
17:18
applied science here for dealing coping
17:24
with the ongoing extinction of species
17:26
and then rapidly on that in terms of
17:30
your field of population ecology on
17:33
comes William cotton and were you aware
17:38
of that book in 1980 overshoot that he
17:41
published or did you become aware of it
17:43
later and just talk about your
17:44
relationship with Katan one of the most
17:48
remarkable things about katan's book
17:51
overshoot to me was it was written by a
17:53
sociologist another Nacala he seemed to
17:56
understand basic ecology better than any
18:00
of my colleagues who were ecologists
18:02
card-carrying ecologists and again it
18:05
took me some time to understand what was
18:07
really going on here perhaps I should
18:09
have mentioned earlier that I had always
18:12
wanted to study something called human
18:13
ecology I couldn't do it I could not
18:17
find a university in North America that
18:20
would teach human ecology as from a
18:22
biological point of view they were
18:24
departments of human ecology in say
18:27
geography departments but it was all
18:29
about human use of resources and the
18:33
sociologists had a little sub branch of
18:35
human ecology but it was based on
18:37
allegories and and so on borrowings from
18:40
European plant physiology and ecology
18:44
just transposed to the human system so
18:47
they considered the succession
18:49
of vegetation in a field for example to
18:52
be comparable to the succession of grand
18:56
uses as mean as a city expands over the
18:59
landscape so it was that kind of limited
19:02
they're very limited at perspective on
19:04
ecology was but nobody study human
19:07
beings as organism as components of and
19:11
essential parts of nature of ecosystems
19:14
it simply wasn't done but the point of
19:16
the matter is to this day most
19:19
psychologists study non-human beings and
19:22
if we're going to look at urban ecology
19:24
its how does the city come up as a
19:28
proper habitat for birds bees or ants or
19:32
caterpillars urge the distribution of
19:35
earthworms along a pollution gradient
19:37
downwind from Chicago might be a typical
19:40
example of urban ecology that's all very
19:43
well but it's really the ecology of
19:45
earthworms with respect to cities rather
19:48
than what I took to be urban ecology we
19:51
really ought to be all about human
19:52
beings it's amazing to me that we
19:55
couldn't see that people humans Homo
19:57
sapiens are not only the creators of the
20:00
urban ecosystem but it's principal
20:02
wantonness yeah yeah well how about
20:05
moving now into also the economics side
20:09
of trying to get an ecological
20:11
understanding into that I understand
20:13
you're one of the founders of the field
20:16
and the Society of ecological economics
20:18
so could you talk a little bit about you
20:21
know your your work in that how you got
20:24
it started and and how it's doing now
20:27
well ecological economics goes back
20:31
again to the period that I was really
20:33
getting underway as an academic the
20:35
ecological footprint concept is really a
20:38
tool in ecological economics so let's
20:42
back up a little bit the main frame of
20:45
economics driving the world today is
20:47
something called neoliberal economics
20:49
and it's basically that form of
20:52
economics which regards the perfect
20:54
market is the openness curvature of all
20:57
social values there's no need for
20:58
government our considerations of moral
21:01
or ethical
21:02
questions are outside of the market just
21:05
like the economy work and things will be
21:07
okay its primary goal of course is to
21:10
foster continued growth and it assumes
21:13
that continuous economical development
21:17
is the tool but which we can achieve
21:18
that now it starts that starting premise
21:23
is that the economy and humankind are
21:27
separate systems by the way this is
21:28
identical to the premise of ecologists
21:31
that humans are separate from the rest
21:33
of the world right so both disciplines
21:36
economics and ecology separate humans
21:39
from everything else so The Economist's
21:42
have the human system over here and the
21:44
ecosphere over here and there's almost
21:47
no important connection between the two
21:49
they do recognize that the economy draws
21:52
on the ecosystems for resources and
21:54
dumps wastes back into it but technology
21:57
can cope with both of those so we see
22:00
with technological advances that
22:03
scarcity is constantly being pushed off
22:05
initially we could go for oil by poking
22:08
a finger in the ground when we got out
22:10
but when those easy to exploit oil wells
22:13
dried up we learned how to go much
22:16
deeper and now we drill for oil several
22:18
kilometers below the bottom of the sea
22:20
and that may be several kilometers below
22:22
the surface of the ocean so we can keep
22:25
developing technologies fracking was
22:27
another one to get new oil that you know
22:30
access resources that we thought were
22:32
impossible a few years ago again think
22:35
of something like copper you used to
22:37
need several percent copper for an order
22:39
to be valuable we used to think the oven
22:41
or that had a trace of copper is utterly
22:44
worthless well today we can exploit that
22:45
because we've developed the technology
22:47
to do so so the economists vision has
22:50
some support this continuous advances
22:53
that keep relock relieving us of
22:55
scarcity
22:56
so that growth seems to carry on and so
22:58
on but the upshot of this is that the
23:01
economy that is vision is envisioned as
23:03
a certain flow of money values with no
23:07
important connectivity to nature
23:10
understand this and once you believe
23:12
that the principle the economy is a
23:15
self-generated
23:16
circular flow of money value and it has
23:18
no important connection to nature you
23:20
have an intellectual concept that
23:22
enables perpetual growth with no
23:25
consequence whatsoever from the natural
23:27
environment
23:28
now ecological economics starts from a
23:31
different premise instead of seeing the
23:34
two as completely separate the economy
23:36
over here in the ecosphere over here we
23:40
regard human beings and their economies
23:43
and social systems as subsystems of the
23:45
much larger whole
23:47
exactly not only that completely
23:49
dependent subsystems on that larger so
23:53
any increase in the flow of materials to
23:56
and from the economy and nature
23:59
necessarily degrades the natural
24:02
component so in effect the ecological
24:06
perspective in ecological economics sees
24:09
the human system is potentially
24:11
parasitic on the ecosphere
24:14
now parasite is any organism that gains
24:16
its vitality at the expense of the
24:18
vitality of the host and once you adopt
24:21
the view that the human subsystem is
24:24
growing by extracting resources in fact
24:27
what it does is convert the ecosphere
24:29
into human bodies and the artifacts of
24:32
culture this is assist in which there's
24:35
a clear potential for parasitism where
24:38
the vitality that the host system is
24:40
destroyed
24:41
even as the parasite grows and then
24:44
becomes most funded in all of its
24:46
ramifications and I think that's exactly
24:48
the situation we're in today the human
24:51
Enterprise continues to grow and expand
24:54
but it's necessarily you see once you
24:56
would understand that it's a subsystem
24:58
the growth that the human Enterprise is
25:00
necessarily at the expense of the rest
25:03
of the system so today if we look at
25:06
mammals for example somewhere between
25:09
let's go back 10,000 years human beings
25:12
were less than 1% of the mass of mammals
25:15
on planet earth like the estimates today
25:18
humans are about 32% of the mammalian
25:22
biomass and the biomass is actually
25:25
increased because people have increased
25:27
the productivity of nature
25:29
humans are 32% of the biomass and our
25:32
domestic animals sheep cattle pigs
25:34
horses and so on I come for another 64%
25:37
perhaps so somewhere depending on his
25:40
baby you look at somewhere between 95
25:43
and 98 and a half percent of all
25:46
mammalian biomass on earth as human
25:48
beings and their domestic animals yes so
25:50
the wild nature has been reduced from
25:53
over 99% of mammalian biomass down to
25:58
just about one and a half to four
26:00
percent in that range that's an
26:02
astonishing example of how the expansion
26:06
with the human Enterprise is necessarily
26:08
at the expense of the rest of nature
26:11
when I go to political meetings and I
26:13
see a politician stand up say there's no
26:15
contradiction between the growth of the
26:17
economy and the maintenance of the
26:19
ecosphere
26:20
I've attempted to stand up and scream oh
26:26
we have to understand that humans don't
26:29
act out of reality human beings acted at
26:33
their social constructs and we socially
26:36
construct the realities from which we
26:38
operate and the current social construct
26:41
is this one of unlimited economic growth
26:45
mediated through perpetually increasing
26:48
technological progress and as long as we
26:50
adhere to that the reality being human
26:54
beings contained within nature the
26:56
reality is then that we are consuming
26:58
nature from the inside out were the
27:00
Apple in the planetary or were maggots
27:03
re in the planetary Apple yeah yeah well
27:07
this leads me directly to ask you to
27:10
really speak to I recently listened to
27:14
Sam Mitchell's fabulous interview with
27:16
you in his collapse chronicles where the
27:19
first 10 or 15 minutes he just asked you
27:21
to explain this plague phase and and
27:23
you've just written something that you
27:25
just sent us to the other day that would
27:26
be published here real soon in the Tyee
27:28
speak to that because that that goes
27:31
exactly with what you're now is talking
27:32
about again if you think of human beings
27:36
as any other species I think there are
27:39
three qualities that we really have to
27:41
keep firmly in my
27:43
the first is that we have exactly the
27:46
same potential for exponential growth as
27:48
any other species exponential growth is
27:50
a simply a growth process by which the
27:53
doubling time is constant and if you
27:56
think about a bacterium being dropped on
27:58
a petri dish if nutrient broth one cell
28:02
bingo under ideal conditions of the
28:05
perfect nutrients and temperature and so
28:08
on they're gonna be two cells they're
28:10
within 20 minutes half an hour but a
28:12
half an hour later is 4 and then 8 and
28:15
then 16 and 32 so the population is
28:19
doubling in constant increments as long
28:21
as the environment is capable of
28:23
providing the nutrients and other ideal
28:26
conditions for that growth so that's
28:29
simply exponential growth of the
28:30
population human beings are people as
28:33
all species are of exponential growth
28:36
normally however in nature populations
28:40
are held in check in their local
28:42
environments by negative feedback so the
28:45
population edges up toward the carrying
28:47
capacity of the environment it gets
28:49
slammed back by the spread of disease
28:51
because of higher densities or because
28:54
there's a shortage of food or because
28:57
the increase in that species population
28:59
has resulted in an increase in predator
29:02
population so they slam it back so
29:04
normally populations can be fluctuate in
29:07
nature in the vicinity of their current
29:10
capacity but the point is humans then
29:13
normally have been kept in check the
29:15
only real growth substantial growth in
29:18
human populations in the last 50,000
29:21
years has been the expansion of people
29:23
over the entire surface of the earth
29:26
within any particular place we
29:28
fluctuated over time okay so what
29:33
happened about 200 years ago there's an
29:36
extremely important event in human
29:37
history
29:38
but it ties to two other aspects that
29:41
humans shared with other species the
29:43
first I've already alluded to and that
29:45
is that all species will tend this is a
29:49
biological
29:52
predisposition compulsiveness word will
29:55
expand to fill all the available habitat
29:57
all of the accessible habitat and the
30:00
game peoples are not necessarily and I
30:02
said they said well it suppose he
30:04
discovered a new island out in the
30:06
mid-pacific say the size of Australia
30:08
that was pristine in all ways you think
30:11
governments of the world would get
30:13
together and say well you know we
30:14
screwed up everywhere else let's just
30:16
leave this one alone not a chance
30:18
we'd be in there in the national slides
30:21
and every peek and so on as the the area
30:24
was cut up and carved up and basically
30:28
colonized by the human parasite as we've
30:31
done everywhere else so we have the same
30:33
predisposition to expand to fill all
30:35
available habitat but the other thing we
30:38
have is a predisposition to consume all
30:40
accessible resources now every species
30:44
does this no difference between humans
30:46
and other species we know of cases for
30:49
example where monkeys who feed on clans
30:52
oddly enough and who discover they can
30:54
crack these clans with rocks quickly
30:56
wipe out the entire clan population
30:59
locally because they learn to use tools
31:01
well people learn to use tools our
31:04
technology is just a word for collection
31:06
of tools and it has enabled us to expand
31:10
expand and expand what others could not
31:12
go so to speak because they don't have
31:15
our technological progress so look at
31:17
now what we've got we have a finite
31:20
planet inhabited by a very clever
31:22
species called Homo sapiens with a
31:26
predisposition to expand indefinitely it
31:30
has a population predisposition to be so
31:32
exponentially and the technological
31:34
capacity to continue to provide the
31:37
resources to enable that expansion and
31:39
to defeat the negative feedback that
31:42
would otherwise focus in check so about
31:45
200 years ago as modern medicine got a
31:47
better grip on ecology and so on
31:50
we discovered during theory and we could
31:53
could suppress disease and modern
31:55
medicine helped us increase our survival
31:58
rate let's face it without much
32:00
affecting the birth rate in fact with
32:02
the use of fossil fuel we
32:05
or debt the extent to which modern
32:06
civilization as a father of fossil fuel
32:09
fossil fuel is the means by which we
32:13
have acquired all the other resources
32:15
necessary to grow the human enterprise
32:17
so look here's the species with the
32:20
potential for potential growth with the
32:22
capacity to modify the environment so
32:26
that it ensures a constant flow of
32:29
resources and the ability to suppress
32:31
any negative resistance to that disease
32:33
of scarcity and so on so just 200 years
32:37
ago for the first time in the history of
32:40
our species we began a truly exponential
32:43
explosion realizing our full biological
32:47
potential just 200 years ago so put this
32:51
in context if you think of modern Anakim
32:54
anatomically modern humans going back at
32:56
least 200 thousand years it took two
32:59
hundred thousand years to reach 1
33:01
million people and then two hundred
33:04
years just 1 1000 to sponge time to blow
33:08
up to almost 8 billion people today
33:10
that's an astonishing event in history
33:14
not only that it's completely a normal
33:18
list and yet we take growth to be the
33:22
norm only maybe 10 generations of people
33:26
that most have experienced enough growth
33:28
or technological change in their
33:31
lifetimes even the notices yes exactly
33:34
understand this this is profoundly
33:36
important to get a grip on our current
33:38
situation so this period this last 200
33:42
years that we take to be done norm and
33:45
which defines how we define ourselves is
33:48
really the single most anomalous period
33:50
in the history of our species so it
33:53
would be an absolute error to suggest
33:56
that we can go back to the norm after
33:58
for example the covert virus pandemic is
34:02
is resolved all people can think about
34:04
is how soon can we get back to normal
34:06
and what I'm arguing is that normal
34:09
generated the problem in the first place
34:12
normally being humans packed together in
34:15
cities where disease can be rampant and
34:17
all the weak
34:19
the conditions to enable the negative
34:21
feedback to start coming on full-time so
34:24
climate change biodiversity loss land
34:27
degradation soil degradation the
34:30
breakdown in the ocean chemistry
34:33
Cobin 19 all of these are examples just
34:37
incipient negative feedback ready to
34:39
come in and they're correct this bridge
34:42
anomaly that has occurred in the last
34:44
200 years now in theory we have the
34:47
intelligence to recognize that this is
34:49
what's going on in in theory we could
34:54
bringing it under control but so far
34:56
there's very little evidence that we've
34:59
realized that at the levels of count you
35:02
may understand it I may understand it
35:04
every morning were being treated in
35:06
Canada now to an hour-long lecture by
35:08
the Prime Minister on how they're doing
35:10
everything possible to get things back
35:11
to normal
35:12
as quickly as possible and I think
35:16
that's a little bit short-sighted yeah I
35:18
couldn't agree more and that actually
35:20
leads me and to want to ask you what is
35:22
it about human nature because this is
35:23
also something that you've studied and
35:25
and teach what is it about human nature
35:27
that is that theoretically we can
35:31
address some of these things but in fact
35:34
the previous hundred civilizations
35:36
unsustainable city-based civilizations
35:38
and Throop eccentric human centered
35:40
civilizations that have crashed and
35:42
burned you know there are people who
35:44
recognize what could change to shift it
35:46
but it never happens what is it about
35:48
human nature in your understanding that
35:50
leads to that there's a wonderful little
35:53
book by Bruce Wexler called brain and
35:55
culture and the bottom line is this that
35:58
in the course of the development of the
36:01
human brain repeated experiences
36:04
repeated ideas the constant repetition
36:07
of anything form the synaptic circuits
36:12
in the brain it shapes the development
36:14
of our thought patterns so that over a
36:19
period of time one can acquire a set way
36:22
of thinking we can call it an ideology
36:24
it can be a political ideology it can be
36:27
a religious doctrine it can be an
36:29
academic paradigm even a scientific
36:32
theory becomes imprinted in the brain
36:35
with its own synaptic circuitry so once
36:38
a particular concept associated with
36:40
that whole idea comes up the whole
36:42
circuit is fired so if I am a neoliberal
36:46
economists with the profound belief in
36:47
globalization as soon as I hear trade
36:51
theory that whole circuitry starts to
36:53
ignite and reinforce itself and so on
36:56
but once we've acquired through this
36:58
experience particular way of thinking
37:01
human beings tend to seek out other
37:04
people who think the same way
37:06
and to seek out experiences that
37:08
reinforce our habitual way of thinking
37:11
the understand I'm getting at here so
37:14
that particular ideological framing of
37:18
events becomes embedded in the brain and
37:21
we tend then once this is in there just
37:24
like to some other stuff we talked about
37:26
earlier we tend to deny reject or forget
37:29
any contrary information yeah so this is
37:32
profoundly important in terms of trying
37:35
to move beyond their current situation
37:37
it requires an enormous shock to get
37:42
people to think of this is thinking
37:43
outside of the box almost quite
37:45
literally the brain box with its
37:47
pre-designed synaptic circuitry has to
37:50
be shattered before we can really grab
37:53
on to the idea that there's a different
37:56
way of doing things and I think we're at
37:58
one of those critical points in our
38:00
existence right now so it is conceivable
38:04
if there were a sufficient shock to the
38:07
global system that we could sit down and
38:10
rethink how to restructure it more in
38:14
conformity to the nature of reality and
38:17
then the current system has been
38:18
constructed again I have to emphasize
38:21
that we socially construct our realities
38:23
they become embedded in synaptic
38:26
circuitry in the brain we then act out
38:29
of that synaptic circuitry far more than
38:31
we do out of the reality and if there's
38:34
a mismatch between the way we think
38:36
about things and the way things really
38:38
are we are headed for trouble and that's
38:41
the trouble we are in as a global
38:43
civilization now the economic paradigm
38:45
the political paradigms from which we
38:47
operate have no useful information
38:50
whatsoever about the nature of the
38:53
biophysical reality within which we are
38:55
parasitically embedded so as long as we
38:59
operate from that way of thinking we
39:02
have no choice there are no options
39:03
available to us to change the nature
39:06
this destructive relationship so the
39:10
first thing and the reason I keep
39:11
battering away at this is hoping we can
39:14
create enough glimmers of light cracks
39:16
in the system that at some point it
39:18
bursts open
39:20
and people got that aha moment where
39:22
they realize together in some way that
39:25
hey we can do this differently what if
39:28
we developed an economy based on the
39:32
idea that we are utterly dependent on
39:34
this other system that we are currently
39:36
draining how could we devise a way of
39:40
allocation and distribution of the goods
39:43
and services of nature so that a much
39:46
reduced population might live
39:48
sustainably within the means the
39:50
productive capacity of the biosphere
39:52
that supports us all of this is possible
39:55
it's another human construct but it
39:58
would be a construct based on the nature
40:00
of the reality in which we find ourself
40:02
again I emphasize we are currently
40:05
operating from an economic system that
40:07
has no formal internalization of the
40:12
structural the temporal or the physical
40:14
properties of the ecosphere that the
40:16
economy is parasitizing and hence it
40:20
cannot be anything but pathological and
40:23
we have to break from pathology are we
40:25
going over there so all of my work is an
40:27
attempt simply to understand to open
40:30
eyes to a different reality well in fact
40:32
the reality at least as I see it and in
40:37
a ballistic crack open the current
40:39
system in ways that enable human beings
40:42
to live more equitably within the
40:46
biophysical means with the ecosphere
40:48
that's the whole mission ahead of us um
40:51
complexity was a big problem for people
40:55
human beings the human brain human
40:58
nervous system evolved and small new
41:01
contexts so we are capable of coping
41:07
reasonably well with a few dozen other
41:09
people at most in relatively confined
41:12
habitats over which we could be no
41:15
significant damage search and perhaps
41:17
and we Rove around over a home range but
41:20
the point of the matter is that human
41:22
beings evolved to cope with a fear leak
41:25
within a lifetime of a person unchanging
41:28
environmental context dealing with a
41:30
relatively few other people
41:33
now in those circumstances it became
41:36
adaptive if in the course of individual
41:40
development one came to very quickly
41:43
assume the beliefs values and
41:46
assumptions the cultural norms of one's
41:48
tribe right because once one acquired
41:51
that a set of beliefs values and
41:54
assumptions the mythology of the tribes
41:56
of the speed it not only added to tribal
41:59
coherence a sense of social coherence
42:02
but it gave one a sense of personal
42:04
identity you could identify with that
42:06
group psychologically very healthy and
42:08
all the rest of it it also by the way
42:10
created a barrier the ingu concept the
42:13
Union human nature every culture that's
42:16
from studied has some in-group of
42:18
concept we are over here they are over
42:21
there and again highly adaptive ten
42:24
thousand fifty thousand two hundred
42:26
thousand years ago so that's the
42:28
beginning of the problem that really
42:31
another natural phenomenon a phenomenon
42:34
but quality of humans is for economist
42:36
actually if called spatial social and
42:39
temporal discounting people naturally
42:42
tend to be favored the here and the now
42:46
close relatives and friends and so on
42:49
over distant places future times and
42:53
people they don't know what's the in
42:55
blue both in the game so it's perfectly
42:58
natural for people to be relatively what
43:01
is the word myopic we are short-sighted
43:06
by nature and the game it was good
43:08
reason for doing so if you didn't have
43:11
if you don't have refrigeration you
43:14
better eat a lot too right now because
43:15
it will go bad and if you didn't get it
43:16
somebody else what would be a typical
43:18
way of reacting to a circumstance about
43:21
ten thousand years ago today of course
43:24
we could in theory abandon that certain
43:27
that nature way of looking at things but
43:30
we don't because it's part of our nature
43:32
to be social discounters temporal
43:35
discounters and spatial discounters so
43:39
people naturally prefer the here then
43:42
now close relatives over
43:45
someplace else some distant future that
43:48
may not affect them in any case and
43:50
other people so this tends to cause us
43:54
to have a very limited view and capacity
43:58
of imagining futures but there's another
44:01
thing that comes out of all of this and
44:02
that is that we've come from a place of
44:07
very simple systems that were at least
44:10
understandable if not controllable to a
44:13
place where we have created a degree of
44:17
complexity that is far beyond the
44:19
capacity of any human mind to wrap
44:21
itself around we live now in a world of
44:24
overlapping complex systems not just the
44:27
spatial system but we have the Internet
44:29
who really understands how the internet
44:31
would know that's money let alone the
44:34
entire economy we've got international
44:38
mechanisms of global trade and so on and
44:41
so forth massively complex systems that
44:45
nobody's capable understand in and of
44:47
themselves and yet they all integrate in
44:50
some way that is beyond the capacity of
44:52
the human imagination so these systems
44:56
all tend to evolve and this gets back to
44:59
your question Michael above the
45:01
evolution of civilizations buzz Hollings
45:05
work on panikker theory also describes
45:07
this Joseph painters work on the
45:10
collapse of complex civilizations Jared
45:12
Diamond in his study collapse how
45:15
nations changed to fail or succeed or a
45:18
wonderful little shorthand we have
45:20
getting into all of this is called a
45:23
short history of progress by a colleague
45:25
of mine here in Vancouver now what we
45:30
have to get at here is that we now
45:32
created a world that is vastly beyond
45:35
our capacity fully to understand
45:39
and systems seem to go through a cycle
45:41
they're fairly simple to start with they
45:45
grow rapidly they are easy to understand
45:48
they reach a point of maturing they
45:51
become a little less complex in the
45:55
sensitive shed redundant systems they
45:58
become more and more brittle but they
46:00
get bigger and bigger at the same time
46:02
if we're talking about a human system we
46:04
see the increase in corruption at the
46:06
top you see increasing income
46:08
disparities you see increasing inability
46:13
to look ahead a greater tendency to
46:16
protect the way things are and so on and
46:18
so forth
46:18
so eventually the system which has
46:21
actually if you think of Joseph painters
46:23
argument he says that the human system
46:25
is a problem-solving system and it's
46:28
growth through this trajectory is one of
46:31
getting increasingly complex every time
46:33
a problem comes up men ingenuity goes to
46:36
work we solve it so we get really
46:38
efficient with our new metal hunting in
46:41
there gathering gear but we deplete our
46:43
ecosystems so we have to invent
46:45
agriculture and that's wonderful but
46:47
then we deplete the local soils so we
46:49
have to invent irrigation and that's
46:51
wonderful but then we have to expand and
46:53
we get bigger now we have dams oh by the
46:55
way that's such a big land base we now
46:58
have to get an army to defend it against
47:00
all these invading tribe so this is some
47:02
just deep bigger and bigger and bigger
47:04
and more expensive until some problem
47:07
comes along that we simply can't cope
47:09
with because by this time there's
47:12
division of labour you've got a priest
47:14
or the governing class peasant classes
47:17
they become disenchanted because they're
47:18
being overtaxed by those corrupt passage
47:20
at the top and so on and so forth and
47:22
then a big issue comes along and the
47:25
whole thing can come tumbling down that
47:27
might be climate change it might be a
47:28
bigger pandemic than this one it could
47:30
be biodiversity loss but that's the
47:33
trajectory that every civilisation is
47:36
ever followed and we seem to be on that
47:38
trajectory one more time if you follow
47:42
the word Jared Diamond they take quite
47:44
different approaches to the idea that
47:46
the societal collapse painter sees it
47:50
largely as a
47:52
kind of a social administrative problem
47:54
the system is incapable of responding
47:58
and responding at the top for the reason
48:00
of the corruption the song that I talked
48:02
about diamond see it as morals and
48:04
environmental factors coming in and
48:06
humans aren't able to control but
48:09
they're both right that's the point all
48:10
of these things are happening
48:12
simultaneously
48:13
we have corrupt leadership all over the
48:15
world we'd have been simply a ecological
48:17
problems all over the world none of them
48:20
seem capable of solving this plus we
48:22
have the human problem our adopting and
48:25
sticking with paradigms that are
48:27
socially constructed which are
48:30
comfortable for some of us have been
48:31
written and particularly those two in
48:33
decision-making positions and they don't
48:36
want to change despite what the rabble
48:37
say in fact they will go and build our
48:40
bunkers and let the raffle go to hell
48:41
that's not an uncommon attitude among
48:44
some super wealthy I understand I think
48:47
New Zealand is even had to stop people
48:49
from the northern hemisphere buying up
48:51
large tracts of museum land precisely to
48:54
escape from the crumbling of the global
48:57
system so the point I'm getting at is
48:59
that there are some problems this may
49:02
simply not be solvable yeah there are
49:05
some problems simply not be solvable and
49:08
we've created a system of such
49:10
overwhelming complexity it's utterly
49:12
unprecedented rule was complex
49:15
Mesopotamia was complex perhaps even you
49:19
know Easter Island civilization was
49:21
complex but they pale to insignificance
49:25
compared with complexity the global
49:27
integrated system that we have created
49:29
we've not only created a globally
49:32
interrelated system but we have
49:34
purposefully because of the mental
49:36
models from which we operate have
49:38
simplified it by agreeing for example
49:42
just in kind delivery so that if I
49:45
manufactured whatever medical equipment
49:48
here in Chicago or in Toronto or
49:50
wherever but all the parts are coming
49:52
from Japan and China and they arrive
49:55
exactly the day I need to put them
49:56
together except when the pandemic shuts
49:59
down the global transportation system so
50:02
we've created this enormously complex at
50:04
the same time soon
50:06
Oh system it is absolutely fragile
50:10
yes exactly Wow that was great yeah I
50:13
forget what Nate Higgins calls it that's
50:15
sort of this amoeba this this this you
50:19
know system that's beyond the control of
50:20
any one individual or group of people
50:23
but it has a life of its own and yet
50:25
it's ultimately gradual in fact as we
50:27
speak he's on another one of these
50:29
gatherings talking about the economic
50:32
and financial implications of the
50:34
cochlear virus pandemic but I'm sure
50:36
he's using some of the same language and
50:39
the other the other resource when people
50:41
are you know what because I've been
50:42
studying the rise and fall of
50:44
civilizations I've read all the people
50:45
that you've just talked about and I
50:47
found William Ophuls little 75 page
50:50
volume called immoderate greatness
50:53
why civilizations fail it's just 75
50:55
pages long it really takes this this
50:58
mountain of literature on collapse and
51:00
and an overshoot and stuff and just
51:02
distills it it's it's the best little
51:04
short introduction to the average
51:05
layperson in terms of the various ways
51:08
that civilizations contract and collapse
51:11
now usually when we're having a
51:13
conversation or Michael having a
51:15
conversation with someone in this post
51:17
doom conversation series the focus in
51:20
the life journey
51:21
is really on the interior side your
51:25
scientist and you've given us a
51:27
wonderful sense of what you as a
51:29
scientist we're seeing as the blockages
51:33
in mainstream science and public
51:36
understanding along the way what I'm
51:38
trying to get now is your wonderful
51:41
story of growing up on a farm where you
51:43
really got your involvement in growing
51:46
everything you ate in a sense of how
51:49
humans just for their food are so
51:51
dependent on the world around us and now
51:55
here you are about 10 years older than I
51:58
am
51:59
and you're still in the game there's a
52:01
lot of people we interview who have left
52:04
behind whatever they were doing in their
52:06
career and they're meditating or they're
52:09
there they're doing some action not
52:11
because it's gonna make a difference but
52:12
because we're supposed to you know do
52:15
something good talk to us about your
52:18
internal journey
52:19
from that farm where you knew you knew
52:23
something was out of kilter when you
52:24
moved out of that farm how have you
52:27
maintained yourself and you're still
52:30
doing it you still got an essay coming
52:32
up how are you able to do it I really
52:40
don't everyone's different each of us is
52:43
a different template to some degree I've
52:46
always just been extremely curious and
52:49
anxious to understand and frankly I
52:53
didn't even know that was the case until
52:55
I as an ecologist but I thought I knew
52:58
everything I needed to know there's a
53:00
smartass young ecologist when I went
53:02
into a planning school and suddenly I'm
53:05
surrounded by sociologists and urban
53:08
planners and economists and other people
53:10
thought it was a nut case
53:11
now you see this is what happens in a
53:14
disciplinary context if one grows up in
53:18
a particular discipline you're
53:20
constantly being reinforced in your
53:21
views by colleagues who think and
53:23
believe the same things right so my
53:26
education began when I as an ecologist
53:30
was inserted into a planning school and
53:33
pretended to understand what the human
53:35
system was all about and suddenly I
53:38
realized two utterly ignorant I was and
53:41
I suddenly had to confront that in the
53:44
planning school so this was an absolute
53:47
revelation to me and it's what kicked me
53:50
off on this journey of ultimately
53:52
learning enough economists to be a
53:54
member of the group of ecological
53:56
economists and ultimately a co-founder
53:58
of the Canadian Society for ecological
54:00
economics I saw that we had to begin to
54:04
cross and blend and integrate these
54:06
disciplines if we were ever even to
54:08
understand each other's language
54:10
and so this is just tremendously
54:14
exciting because it opens a potential
54:16
potential potential so the idea of when
54:19
I had I didn't have to I had prostate
54:21
cancer so I retired from the university
54:23
thinking I might not have a whole bunch
54:25
of time left at 68 but I've been busier
54:28
ever since than I was then exploring the
54:31
same kinds of ideas because
54:33
I can't this is the way I am continue to
54:37
think about these things and wonder what
54:39
comes next I think I'm finally getting
54:43
it because you're one of the few people
54:45
in this series that's in a position to
54:49
be able to work the mainstream toward
54:54
shifting ideas and so you're still in
54:57
the game I don't get a sense that unlike
55:00
a lot of us here that we've curled up on
55:02
the couch in a fetal position and gone
55:04
doomed for three days you haven't done
55:06
that because you're working in ideas
55:08
you're not activism it's activists out
55:11
on the streets you know protesting this
55:13
that and the other and at some point you
55:15
just give up but you're still in the
55:17
game because your ideas might still make
55:20
a difference do it do I have your right
55:22
is that is that who you are in this well
55:25
that's hope I mean I don't have much
55:28
confidence but my hope will be realized
55:31
but it is my hope I mean you mentioned
55:35
the ecological footprint I described it
55:37
a little bit earlier it was a
55:39
metaphorical concept I had no idea that
55:43
it would become within a decade probably
55:45
the best known indicator of
55:47
sustainability at least among people who
55:50
even begin to think that way
55:51
so they didn't idea the idea that we are
55:53
so intimately connected to the ecosphere
55:56
it never occurred to most people it just
55:58
had to be birthed in language yes this
56:01
um say ecological footprint is just a
56:04
linguistic term but it captures so much
56:07
because people see an imprint it's on
56:11
the land and they make that mental
56:13
connection and extend it it's not
56:15
difficult to understand that if I you
56:17
know forty seven pounds of carrots there
56:20
had to be a specific you know two square
56:23
meters of the Earth's surface dedicated
56:24
of producing those carriers but that
56:26
applies right across the board to
56:28
everything and that's not hard to get so
56:31
once people get some insightful little
56:34
ideas they begin to act out of them I
56:37
mean that's the whole idea of socially
56:38
constructing or reality see I believe
56:40
there is a reality out there we simply
56:43
have to put it together in our heads in
56:45
some way that map
56:47
well to that external reality right now
56:51
here we are on planet earth the most
56:55
complex entity you can possibly imagine
56:57
and we're trying to navigate it fly it
57:00
through the universe with the
57:01
intellectual equivalent of a 1955
57:04
Volkswagen Beetle drivers manual it's
57:07
simply it's a complete mismatch just
57:10
doesn't yeah yeah amen
57:13
any final things you want to say to
57:15
bring this conversation to completion
57:17
this has been absolutely fabulous bill I
57:20
guess there is one thing that it's
57:24
sometimes difficult for scientists to
57:26
talk about and that's the need for love
57:29
and compassion
57:32
human beings do not will not protect
57:36
that which they do not love and one of
57:41
the great regrets that I have is I
57:45
acquired this from years and years of
57:48
you know climbing school urban in
57:50
regional planning is the complete
57:52
dissociation most urban growers have
57:55
from the landscape from the ecosystems
57:59
that support them
58:00
there's no cognitive sense that we are
58:03
literally a part of nature that we are
58:06
made out of star stuff that do we want
58:08
to use that for the knowledge and so we
58:13
have no love for nature any longer now
58:15
when I say we I'm talking about the
58:18
majority of society the governing system
58:20
and all that some individuals do
58:23
obviously but for the most part we are
58:26
an alien on our own planet so until and
58:30
unless humans reacquire some sense of
58:33
compassion for other species some sense
58:35
of compassion for other human beings in
58:38
other places so please let us have some
58:42
compassion for other humans for the rest
58:45
of nature and for this planet upon which
58:48
we live
58:55
you
