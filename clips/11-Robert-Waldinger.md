00:04
what actually are the conditions that
00:07
help us be happy and healthy as we go
00:10
through life for the last century we
00:14
have measured our well-being as nations
00:17
as a planet based on one particular
00:21
measure gross domestic product if we
00:25
were getting wealthier if our economies
00:27
were growing we were thriving we were
00:30
happier but people began to notice about
00:33
20 years ago that all of our countries
00:37
had gotten wealthier
00:39
as Anna has shown us but that in fact as
00:42
a species we have gotten less happy so
00:47
people began to take the study of
00:49
happiness and well-being much more
00:51
seriously and now the United Nations
00:53
prepares a report every year from
00:56
surveys all over the world asking people
00:59
what are the things that you need in
01:02
your life to make you feel like your
01:04
life has meaning and that you are happy
01:06
and yes it turns out that making sure
01:10
you have enough money to take care of
01:12
the basic needs for yourself and your
01:14
family that's very important for
01:16
happiness but once you get beyond taking
01:19
care of your basic needs the more your
01:22
income Rises happiness Rises hardly at
01:26
all so if it's not our gross domestic
01:31
product what are the things that people
01:33
say all over the world and they say them
01:36
with remarkable uniformity they talk
01:40
about social support believing that they
01:43
have the support of their neighbors and
01:46
their society they talk about the belief
01:50
that they can live a healthy life and
01:52
that they can get the health care they
01:54
need for themselves and their children
01:57
that they have the freedom to make the
01:59
most important life choices for
02:02
themselves and everybody all over the
02:06
world talks about wanting to have
02:09
opportunities to be generous not just
02:11
with money but with their energy being
02:15
able to volunteer and give of their town
02:18
to other people and finally trust the
02:21
absence of corruption certainly in our
02:24
governments but also trust in each other
02:26
people want to be able to believe that
02:29
they can trust their neighbors and that
02:31
that contributes to a healthy life so
02:34
these are the things that people report
02:36
in almost every culture in the world
02:41
what is it that young people think that
02:44
they're going to need as they go through
02:46
life we had a survey in the United
02:48
States about six years ago that asked
02:52
Millennials people in their 20s what are
02:55
your most important life goals and over
02:58
80% of those young adults said that the
03:02
most important thing for them in life
03:04
was going to be to get rich and over
03:09
half of those same young adults said
03:12
that their second major life goal was
03:14
going to be to become famous and finally
03:19
most of them said that it was very
03:22
important that they achieve more and
03:24
more and more at work and that these
03:27
were the things that were going to lead
03:29
them to feel like they had led happy
03:30
lives
03:31
so what's responsible through this
03:34
disconnect between what people tell us
03:36
all over the world about what really
03:39
contributes to happiness and what people
03:41
starting out in life think they're going
03:43
to need well a lot of this has to do
03:48
with all the messages that come at us
03:50
all day long
03:51
about what we should value about what we
03:54
should care about the idea that the good
03:56
life gets defined for us through all
03:59
these media messages and not so much by
04:03
us so think about it how many of you use
04:07
social media Facebook Instagram WeChat
04:11
how many yeah almost all of us do so
04:15
this is a typical photo right the kind
04:18
of photo that we put up showing people
04:21
about our lives if you were coming from
04:23
outer space and you didn't know anything
04:25
about human beings and you wanted to
04:28
know you about human life if your only
04:30
source of information
04:31
were Facebook and Instagram you would
04:34
believe that we were always at a party
04:37
or we were always on a beautiful beach
04:40
somewhere and even though we know that
04:43
this isn't all there is to life it's
04:46
very difficult to see this and not to
04:49
believe that somehow we're missing out
04:52
we're always comparing our insides to
04:56
other people's outsides I'm always
04:59
comparing my insides which include
05:02
sometimes great joy but sometimes waking
05:05
up in the morning feeling lost and
05:08
confused feeling sad feeling like I
05:11
don't know what I'm doing with my life
05:12
with other people's outsides those
05:16
curated lives that we present to each
05:19
other those extraordinary events that
05:21
Anna was talking about but on the
05:23
positive side
05:24
those parties and beautiful beaches
05:26
that's not mostly our lives so how do we
05:32
actually learn about real life about
05:34
what life is like for most of us well
05:37
most of what we know about human life we
05:40
know from asking people to report on the
05:42
past to remember but as we know our
05:47
memories are full of inaccuracies and
05:50
gaps and sometimes we make things up the
05:55
American writer Mark Twain wrote some of
05:59
the worst things in my life never
06:01
happened because he knew that we tend to
06:05
create the past so what I'm gonna tell
06:10
you about today is this study that is
06:13
exceedingly rare which is a study that's
06:16
been going for 80 years following the
06:19
same people from the time they were
06:21
children or teenagers all the way into
06:24
old age 724 people who have been
06:30
followed now into their 90's for those
06:33
who are still living and who are still
06:36
participating with us the Harvard study
06:39
of adult development is as far as we
06:42
know the longest study of
06:44
same people throughout life that has
06:46
ever been done it began with two groups
06:49
of young men one was a group of Harvard
06:53
College students 19 years old who were
06:58
chosen by their Dean's as being among
07:00
the best and the brightest and the other
07:02
was a group of boys from Boston's
07:05
poorest neighborhoods and boys who
07:08
families were known to social service
07:11
agencies for having a great deal of
07:13
trouble mental illness domestic violence
07:16
physical illness extreme poverty now all
07:20
of these 724 people were male that they
07:25
were all white because in the city of
07:28
Boston in 1938 when the study began it
07:32
was 97 percent Caucasian but because
07:37
they were all male we have made every
07:39
effort now to bring women in both the
07:42
wives of these men and now their
07:44
children who are half women and
07:46
everything that I present today includes
07:49
research findings that have been
07:51
corroborated in studies with women as
07:53
well as with men because we know that
07:56
studying only white males is not the way
07:59
to learn about real life but studying
08:03
about these men has been an
08:05
extraordinary source of information so
08:07
we initially brought them in and
08:10
interviewed them and did physical exams
08:13
and we talked to their parents and then
08:18
all of these men grew up and went into
08:22
all different professions factory
08:24
workers lawyers doctors bricklayers one
08:28
president of the United States John F
08:31
Kennedy was part of this group and many
08:34
other people who led wonderful ordinary
08:37
lives and finally we followed people
08:40
into retirement so we studied their
08:46
mental health their physical health
08:47
their work lives their close
08:50
relationships and their community
08:52
relationships the Harvard men were old
08:55
enough to go to serve in World War
08:57
so we studied their World War two
09:00
experiences and as they got older we
09:03
studied Aging and retirement and we
09:05
didn't just ask them to remember the
09:07
past although we did ask them to fill
09:09
out questionnaires about their lives
09:11
every two years but we got their medical
09:14
records from their doctors we brought
09:17
their wives in and asked them to talk
09:19
about their deepest concerns with their
09:21
wives and we videotaped them we drew
09:24
their blood we scanned their brains and
09:27
some of these men even donated their
09:29
brains to us after they died so what did
09:33
we learn well there were over 200 papers
09:36
generated from this study and over 20
09:39
books and one finding kept emerging one
09:44
result that we didn't believe when we
09:47
first saw and the finding was this that
09:51
the people who stayed the happiest and
09:53
the healthiest as they went through
09:55
their adult lives were the people who
09:58
were more connected to other people and
10:00
that means people who saw more people
10:03
every day who spent more time
10:05
socializing with other people and not
10:09
just seeing more people having more
10:12
people in your life but having warm
10:14
close relationships so the people who
10:16
felt securely connected to at least one
10:19
other person that somebody would be
10:22
there if they were really sick or scared
10:24
or in trouble those were the people who
10:26
seemed to stay the healthiest what we
10:29
mean by that is that they developed the
10:31
diseases of aging less soon they were
10:34
less likely to get diabetes heart
10:37
disease arthritis that their brains
10:39
didn't decline as fast as they grew old
10:43
compared with younger people and we
10:45
thought how could this be so now we are
10:48
trying to understand all the mechanisms
10:50
by which the quality of our
10:52
relationships actually gets into our
10:54
bodies and our brains but this finding
10:57
has been corroborated by other research
10:59
groups all over the world one of the
11:03
things we find is that the experience of
11:05
loneliness is very bad for our health
11:07
that that experience of being less can
11:10
to others then you want to be turns out
11:14
to bring physical decline cognitive
11:18
decline and of course make us less happy
11:20
and in the United States one in four
11:23
people reports that they are less
11:25
connected to other people than they want
11:27
to be one of the things we get to look
11:29
at when we ask people to report about
11:31
their lives time after time after time
11:34
is what happens to relationships over
11:36
time so marriage for example how
11:39
satisfied we are in our marriage is at
11:42
its highest we're the most satisfied
11:44
when we first begin with our partners no
11:46
surprise and then when our first child
11:49
is born marital satisfaction goes down
11:52
but then when the last child leaves home
11:55
and moves out marital satisfaction goes
11:58
up again and then in the United States
12:02
only if your children come back to live
12:05
at home does marital satisfaction go
12:07
down again but the other thing that we
12:11
learn about these relationships our
12:13
close relationships our friendships is
12:15
that you don't have to be smooth all the
12:17
time arguing is not a problem that
12:21
really what we need in our relationships
12:24
is a bedrock of affection and respect
12:26
and as long as that is there doesn't
12:29
matter if you argue so the other thing
12:34
we can learn about is what makes us
12:37
happiest so we're constantly given these
12:40
messages that we will be happier if we
12:42
buy things a wonderful car or a
12:44
beautiful TV but it turns out that the
12:47
best things in life are not things that
12:50
when we actually use our resources to
12:53
get new experiences rather than new
12:55
material objects we're happier for
12:58
longer and we actually get a bigger
13:00
boost in happiness so why is that well
13:03
actually when we buy things material
13:06
things lend themselves to comparing so
13:09
if I buy a big flat-screen TV I bring it
13:12
home I'm all excited but then I go to my
13:15
neighbor's house and he's got a bigger
13:17
flat-screen TV and I tend to compare
13:19
myself makes me less happy
13:22
but new experiences bring us into
13:25
contact with new people this was a on a
13:28
family trip that my wife and my sons and
13:31
I went to in Alaska with people we had
13:34
never met before but also these new
13:36
experiences bring us into new kinds of
13:39
relationships with the people we love
13:41
and that people were close to with our
13:42
friends and our family so I've told you
13:46
about the importance of relationships
13:48
now I'm going to give you some bad news
13:50
which is that we have stopped investing
13:54
in relationships so Robert Putnam was a
13:57
sociologist is a sociologist in the
13:59
United States who writes about what he
14:03
calls the decline in social capital how
14:05
much are we investing in each other how
14:08
much do we go out in the evening how
14:11
much do we attend church or synagogue or
14:13
mosque how much do we volunteer in our
14:16
communities and what he found was that
14:18
in the 1950s in the United States and
14:21
soon thereafter in Europe and other
14:24
parts of the world people stopped
14:26
stopped seeing friends stopped going out
14:29
stopped having family dinners and what
14:33
did that coincide with in the United
14:35
States in the 1950s what wonderful new
14:38
invention entered into all of our houses
14:41
can you guess television so we all
14:46
stopped going out and we sat in our
14:48
living rooms and watched these screens
14:51
so then Robert Putnam went back in the
14:53
late 90s and the early 2000s and he
14:56
found that again our investment in our
14:59
communities had gone down further by 25%
15:03
for example in several of these
15:07
parameters actually more than half in
15:09
joining clubs and civic organizations
15:11
down by a third in family dinners which
15:15
are so important for child development
15:17
and family cohesion in 1983 when Putnam
15:21
asked Americans do you have anybody that
15:24
you can confide in 12% said there was no
15:28
one in the world they could talk to
15:29
about personal matters and in 2003 that
15:32
had more than
15:33
- one in four people saying there was no
15:36
one they could confined him so what do
15:38
we do with this decline in investment in
15:42
each other well this next wave was
15:46
fueled by these wonderful screens that
15:48
we are so attached to and what happens
15:52
is that our closest relationships are
15:54
easy to neglect when we are all on our
15:57
phones and on our laptops and on our
15:59
tablets the other thing we talked about
16:02
is how worried we are about our children
16:04
and what these screens are doing to our
16:06
children but in fact what are they doing
16:09
to us so how do we lean into
16:13
relationships how do we change this
16:15
trend that is dragging us all away from
16:19
investing in each other so now I'd like
16:22
to bring a quote from one of my Zen
16:24
teachers who wrote attention is the most
16:28
basic form of love attention is the most
16:33
basic form of love if you think about it
16:36
our undivided attention is the most
16:38
precious thing that we have to give each
16:41
other and that's something you can
16:44
decide to do in any moment you can
16:46
decide to pay
16:48
undivided attention to each other when
16:50
you're out on the break rather than
16:52
everyone being on their phones so our
16:57
undivided attention we can give during
17:00
date nights with spouses to liven up
17:04
relationships that have been going on
17:05
too long we can give our undivided
17:09
attention to each other at family
17:11
dinners where we make sure we make time
17:13
to eat together we can volunteer in our
17:16
communities all of these are ways to
17:19
give what our most precious resource to
17:22
each other so my take-home messages are
17:25
simple that science tells us that human
17:28
connection is a major source not just of
17:31
happiness but of our health that
17:33
technology has the power to isolate us
17:36
just as it has the power to connect us
17:39
and we need to learn more about how
17:41
these things work
17:42
and that our lives can be structured to
17:46
actively combat isolation but that it's
17:49
something we have to work at we have
17:53
actually been trying to bring these
17:55
findings from our lifespan research out
17:58
into places where people can use this
18:01
content to invest more in each other and
18:04
in themselves so I'd like to close with
18:07
a quote from one of my favorite writers
18:10
Maya Angelou who wrote my mission in
18:13
life is not merely to survive but to
18:16
thrive and to do so with some passion
18:19
some compassion some humor and some
18:23
style so investing in each other is
18:27
something we can do to fulfill this
18:30
mission we can do it right now thank you
18:34
very much
18:34
[Applause]
18:38

18:40
