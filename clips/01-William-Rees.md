Resilient Cities: What if 'can-do' can't? (PCI Fellow William Rees)
https://youtu.be/ugv0OY6LyuE


00:00
pleasure now to introduce one of
00:03
Canada's most eminent environmental
00:06
scientists as well as one of Canada's
00:09
most effective teachers for the past 40
00:13
years bill Reese has carved out a niche
00:18
at the University of British Columbia
00:19
within the school of comity and regional
00:21
planning and I think part of bills
00:24
legacy is in this room this week because
00:27
so many of the planners who are working
00:30
hard to reshape Vancouver and other
00:33
cities learn their craft in part under
00:37
bills guidance and tutelage bill is of
00:40
course also the code developer of the
00:42
ecological footprint and he has a
00:46
penetrating mind a rigorous commitment
00:53
to research and the ability I think
00:56
better than most to take that research
00:59
and intellect and couple it to applied
01:02
policy in a way that should light the
01:05
way ahead for all of us please join me
01:07
in welcoming professor bill Reese
01:19
well thank you very much Rob that's
01:22
probably the most generous introduction
01:24
I've had for a long time so annoying
01:26
annoying friends I'm going to also thank
01:29
gene if I make and I have my slides up
01:32
here I have a particular reason for
01:34
doing this and it is that he gave me
01:37
this title and I said what can you do
01:40
with a title like that what if can do
01:43
can't so I thought about it for a while
01:46
and what you're about to hear is what
01:49
I've attempted to do with that title now
01:51
I haven't been tutored in how to work
01:52
this machine but we'll see if it works
01:54
Rob mentioned that I am a scientist and
01:57
I will speak to you as a scientist
01:59
particularly as ana college 'used which
02:01
frees me from the burden of having to be
02:03
practical for the time being so I'm not
02:05
oriented to design I'm not oriented to a
02:08
city building per se but what I want to
02:11
do is to talk about the groundwork and I
02:13
want to start at the end of my
02:15
presentation in case I never get there
02:17
these are the main take away point a no
02:21
locate made some reference to this the
02:23
first point is that perception is
02:25
everything our perceptions determine how
02:28
we act out in the world cities are an
02:32
emergent phenomena they just don't
02:34
happen they come out of how we think
02:37
about ourselves in relation to nature so
02:40
the structure and function of cities the
02:43
city's reflects how we think about that
02:46
relationship and unfortunately our
02:48
techno industrial culture is a society
02:51
of dualistic reductionism we think of
02:55
humans are separate from nature reduce
02:57
everything down to tiny parts and we
02:59
never seem to be able to assemble these
03:01
in our minds as we go forward so in this
03:04
context modern cities have emerged from
03:07
our way of thinking on the landscape as
03:10
fractured in complete human ecosystems
03:14
they parasitize the ecosphere in the
03:16
present structure for sustainability if
03:19
we're serious about this city's must
03:22
become much more self-reliant much more
03:26
self-producing self-organizing they must
03:28
be much more complete as ecosystems
03:31
and I begin to think when I hear these
03:33
words of something that I'm calling an
03:35
eco centered regional city-state
03:38
provinces by the way have long since
03:40
become obsolete for reasons I'll get to
03:42
toward the end there are two elements of
03:45
context here one is the scientist show
03:49
no models so those of you who are
03:50
skeptical global models everything on
03:52
the board here is going to be a real
03:55
data so these are real data about the
03:57
human population explosion and the
04:00
explosion of the human enterprise I
04:02
could have extended the x-axis into the
04:04
next room for 50,000 or a hundred
04:06
thousand or even a million years it
04:08
would have been just as flat as the
04:10
2,000 years i'm showing you and what you
04:13
have to take from this is that the past
04:15
eight generations of humans live in a
04:17
completely anomalous abnormal period of
04:21
human history a period of growth in fact
04:25
it's only been two generations that
04:26
people since the 1950s in which economic
04:29
growth or any form of growth has
04:31
actually been an instrument of public
04:33
policy so what we take to be the norm is
04:36
actually the single most abnormal phase
04:38
in the history of our species and if I
04:40
were looking at any other species I
04:42
would call this the plague phase of the
04:45
species exploitation of its environment
04:48
which inevitably leads to implosion I've
04:52
got time to spend on the implosion part
04:54
the second part of context again goes
04:57
back to the human mind and it has to do
04:59
with the psychology that no locate
05:01
talked about are you know read the text
05:03
and i'll explain it and so while the end
05:06
of the world scenario will be rife with
05:07
unimaginable horrors the pre end period
05:11
is full of opportunities for profit and
05:14
that's exactly how we're approaching
05:16
this issue we have an intellectual
05:19
understanding of the nature of our
05:21
dilemma but a response to it is too
05:24
green business to develop all sorts of
05:26
ways to make additional money to grow in
05:28
a somewhat different way when we think
05:31
the way that we do so the can-do vision
05:36
that gene challenged me with i think is
05:40
incorporated in the notion that we can
05:42
grow different
05:44
using technology to move us forward in
05:47
pretty much the same way as we have in
05:48
the past without any substantial changes
05:51
in our way of doing business so there's
05:53
a problem but our response Springs from
05:56
our belief in human ingenuity and the
05:59
incredible capacity of people to deal
06:00
with crisis it's always worked in the
06:02
past it will continue to work in the
06:04
future and perhaps the most EBU liant
06:07
expression of this is from the late
06:09
professor Julian Simon who wrote many
06:11
books with titles like the ultimate
06:14
resource referring to the human mind
06:16
technology exists now to produce in
06:19
inexhaustible quantities all the
06:21
products made by nature we have the
06:23
technology to feed clothe and supply
06:25
energy to an ever-growing population for
06:28
the next seven billion years that should
06:30
stir you in your hearts because this is
06:32
the essence of true optimism and by the
06:35
way it's also paralytic because if you
06:37
believe this then there's no need to do
06:39
anything at all well I want to suggest
06:43
that this attitude this techno fits
06:49
approach the can-do attitude has led us
06:52
astray most approaches to climate change
06:55
global change in general such as
06:59
renewable energy hybrid cars green
07:01
buildings Smart Growth new urbanism
07:03
green consumerism a very long list are
07:06
delusional they do not take into account
07:10
the science in any significantly
07:12
important transformative way they assume
07:16
we can maintain growth through greater
07:18
material and energy efficiency it's
07:21
really the status quo by other
07:23
technological means now here is really
07:26
the key to what I'm getting at here what
07:28
the science says is that we need an
07:31
absolute reduction in energy and
07:34
material throughput in our economy of
07:36
about eighty percent by mid-century to
07:39
avoid catastrophic climate change so you
07:41
can accept it or not it's probably safer
07:44
to accept it if it's even marginally
07:46
true i'm going to assume it is true for
07:47
the sake of argument so the bottom line
07:50
is that whatever you're doing if we need
07:53
that eighty percent of reduction if your
07:55
soul
07:56
Shin if where you are working does not
07:58
result in an absolute reduction in
08:01
energy and material use in your
08:03
community in your building or whatever
08:05
then you're not on track you're not part
08:08
of the solution you're really
08:09
contributing more to the problem so I
08:12
wanted to be a few examples of what I'm
08:14
getting on here this is a recent
08:17
addition of the ford escape hybrid
08:19
vehicle note that they appropriate one
08:22
of our most powerful green cultural
08:23
symbols from at the Frog that's a really
08:26
authoritative figure but the point is
08:28
that we pander to the you we all want to
08:32
be good you know I want to be nice so
08:34
I'm going to buy this car instead of
08:36
another cut like the toyota echo for
08:38
example which gets 50 miles to the
08:40
gallon but it's not green because it's
08:41
not a hybrid so here we have the
08:44
appropriation of a cultural symbol in
08:46
the sale of more goods that are in fact
08:49
they frankly not a particularly good
08:50
example of anything and again as Richard
08:53
register said it just perpetuates the
08:55
illusion that cities ought to be built
08:57
around automobiles and this is actually
09:00
a fairly benign example try this one
09:04
this is the Chevy I just stand these
09:07
from some recent magazines this is the
09:10
Tahoe Hybrid this vehicle weighs 7,000
09:14
300 pounds that's 3.3 metric tons but
09:20
it's hybrid and because it's a hybrid by
09:22
the way it's gets the lowest gas mileage
09:24
of any hybrid vehicle on the planet but
09:26
it's a hybrid and so it merits the green
09:29
car of the year award for 2008 now again
09:34
people run out and buy this sort of
09:36
thing because it makes them feel good
09:38
about contributing to the planet the
09:40
only way to think about that is is
09:42
everybody drove one of these seven
09:45
thousand three hundred pound or 3.3
09:47
metric ton vehicles would the earth be a
09:50
healthier place which gets lousy gas
09:51
mileage by the way how could it get good
09:54
mass mileage it weighs more than the
09:56
average elephant so we're in cities we
10:02
live in buildings we're all moving to
10:04
green buildings green architecture green
10:06
housing so between 1950
10:09
2004 the average new house in North
10:12
America went from about nine hundred or
10:15
a thousand square feet up to about 2,300
10:17
square feet an increase of a hundred and
10:19
thirty-five percent over a half century
10:22
period during which the green rhetoric
10:25
continually accelerated okay everything
10:28
about them is bigger we will run from
10:30
you know you parked your car in the lane
10:32
24 car garages now not being uncommon in
10:35
some of these homes they all have
10:37
industrial scale appliances 9-foot
10:40
ceilings and so on meanwhile well the
10:43
house size is more than doubling we see
10:45
a shrinkage of family size from 3.7 to
10:48
2.6 people so that floor space per
10:52
capita increases by two hundred and
10:54
thirty-six percent during the period of
10:56
the loudest green rhetoric you can
10:59
possibly imagine on the planet but these
11:01
houses a tiny fracture them are about
11:04
twenty five percent more efficient per
11:07
unit area as the 1950s house so it's
11:11
completely delusional to think we've
11:13
made progress these new large-scale
11:16
so-called green houses haven't a
11:18
fraction of the green associated with
11:20
them as the primitive old 1950s nine
11:24
hundred or a thousand square foot houses
11:26
we're living in a complete fantasy land
11:28
and as I say the way we think about
11:30
things produces the products and the
11:34
marketing and all the rest of it that is
11:36
shaping the culture that is taking the
11:38
planet down now in that kind of context
11:42
cities couldn't be resilient but we've
11:46
created them to be among the most
11:47
vulnerable structures on the planet I
11:50
love this quote that I found only 10
11:51
where he said it but Martin oppenheim in
11:54
American sociologist today city is the
11:56
most vulnerable social structure ever
11:58
conceived they're threatened by peak oil
12:01
by soil losses by climate change by
12:03
geopolitical instability all of these
12:05
things of course are tied together I
12:07
wish I had more time to explain to you
12:10
why we're not even sensitive to this as
12:11
yet but I want to say that much of it
12:14
has to do with the way we have conceived
12:17
our cities cities are in complete
12:20
systems they are not the human ecosyst
12:23
the idea of an eco city in a way
12:25
different from what i'm going to talk
12:26
about doesn't make any real sense so if
12:29
you were to encapsulate Vancouver in a
12:32
bell jar or New York or any modern city
12:34
it would suffocate and starve
12:36
simultaneously because the productive
12:39
zone producing everything needed to
12:41
maintain or sustain the city is
12:43
happening elsewhere the city is the
12:46
human equivalent of a livestock feed lot
12:48
it's where we gather large numbers of
12:51
people but the productive landscaping
12:53
landscape sustaining it is you know
12:55
scattered all over the planet cities
12:57
have become by virtue of the way we
13:00
think about ourselves as separate from
13:02
nature parasitic blobs on the landscape
13:05
horrible language to use that could is a
13:07
beautiful place to live but it's by far
13:09
from being sustainable we've known about
13:12
this again for decades since the
13:14
beginning of the environmental movement
13:15
of Eugene Odum one of the great American
13:18
ecologists defined cities as parasitic
13:20
they are planned and grow without any
13:22
regard for the fact that they must
13:24
process vast quantities of waste and you
13:27
know consume huge quantities of
13:29
resources now there's another
13:30
fundamental physical law called the
13:33
second law of thermodynamics which makes
13:35
the second two of these statements
13:37
absolutely true we think of ourselves as
13:41
producers we want to increase the
13:43
productivity of the economy of Labor
13:46
economy and all of that but the simple
13:48
biophysical reality is that every act of
13:51
human production involves the
13:53
consumption of a vastly larger quantity
13:55
of energy and material so all human
13:58
economic production is mostly
14:00
consumption cities produce the wealth of
14:02
nations only by consuming a vast
14:05
quantity of natural wealth produced
14:07
elsewhere in the ecosphere far from the
14:10
boundaries of the city themselves and
14:11
here's an example of the parasitic
14:14
nature of the human ecosystem or rather
14:18
of our urban culture this is from Edward
14:21
Burtynsky s new book on oil I was
14:23
honored to have written an introductory
14:24
chapter to this but I saw this
14:26
photograph I was floored because it
14:27
reminds I used to work in the far north
14:29
you stick your arm out the window and it
14:31
will be covered by 190 mosquitoes within
14:33
30 seconds so these are mesquite
14:36
shows great mechanical mosquito sucking
14:38
the blood from the earth and pumping it
14:41
down to the city to where it's consumed
14:44
in making a whole lot of other nasty
14:47
things so if you want to kind of image
14:49
what I'm talking about here just think
14:51
of a number of pristine ecosystems
14:54
natural forests grasslands marine
14:56
estuaries coral reefs or whatever now
14:59
contemplate forest clear cuts eroding
15:01
farmlands depleted fisheries and marine
15:04
Z dead zones the only thing connecting
15:07
those two images is human economic
15:09
economic activity because that's the way
15:12
we think we're not part of nature so it
15:15
doesn't matter what we do out there it
15:17
won't affect us over here well this is
15:19
what's going on in northern Alberta this
15:22
used to be boreal forest again it take
15:25
from Burton skis latest book it looks
15:28
like an oil spill in your driveway but
15:30
in the middle there I've pointed out a
15:32
huge warehouse this is a tens of
15:35
thousands of hectares of utterly
15:37
desecrated landscape to feed the
15:39
insatiable appetite of the Ford escapes
15:42
and the Chevy Tahoes in the cities far
15:47
away where this kind of thing as out of
15:49
sight and out of mind so how much of
15:53
nature do we actually appropriate in
15:55
that way and this is what we've done in
15:57
the development of our occult my
15:58
ecological footprint concept it's simply
16:01
a measure of the amount of productive
16:04
landscape required by any population an
16:06
individual a city a nation to produce
16:09
what it consumes and to assimilate its
16:11
wastes you all have a footprint and
16:14
because there's a declining amount of
16:16
productive biol space out there your
16:19
footprint is growing as the available
16:22
supply is shrinking and as populations
16:25
increase we're all competing with each
16:28
other whether you're conscious of it or
16:30
not for the available bio space we
16:33
compete very successfully because we
16:35
have very high incomes enabling us to
16:37
buy in global markets everybody else's
16:40
equal footprints so the average
16:42
ecological requirements of a person in
16:45
this room is somewhere on the order of
16:46
seven hectares something like seven
16:48
they're 20 acres in that range the
16:51
poorest of the poor live on a third of a
16:53
hectare just a little lesson an acre on
16:57
earth there are two average hectares per
17:00
capita so each of us in this room
17:01
requires three to four times an
17:04
equitable share the global bio capacity
17:07
to sustain us in the style to which bear
17:09
a custom and despite all of the greening
17:12
of our economy this number gets bigger
17:14
year in and year out as our salaries
17:17
increase and as technological biz Mo's
17:21
fail because of something called the
17:23
rebound effect the principal biophysical
17:27
impact of improvements in technological
17:29
efficiency is to increase consumption
17:32
counterintuitive but there it is now the
17:36
problem is that many countries now
17:38
because their populations have such
17:40
large footprints live mostly on land and
17:44
water productivity located outside of
17:47
their own boundaries every country in
17:49
Europe requires two or three times the
17:52
size of its domestic bio capacity to
17:54
sustain itself what globalization does
17:57
has enabled the wealthy countries to
17:59
extend their footprints into the
18:01
productive landscapes of other countries
18:03
and over the global Commons now there's
18:06
two evil effects of this the first is it
18:09
removes from consciousness our
18:11
dependence on ecosystems because we
18:14
don't even see that we're dependent on
18:16
our local ecosystems as we're not
18:18
secondly since everybody's doing this
18:20
it's drawing down the natural capital
18:23
assets and filling up the sinks all over
18:26
the planet so as we bussli move forward
18:29
in our consumer lifestyles we're
18:31
actually all rising simultaneously to a
18:34
lowering global ceiling of a true limits
18:38
to growth so one planet living would be
18:41
living within the productive capacity of
18:44
earth and if we did that we'd have to
18:45
reduce our footprints to two hectares
18:47
per capita from the current roughly
18:49
seven but we're not doing that
18:51
population is increasing per capita
18:53
consumption is increasing even faster so
18:56
there's an accelerating upslope in terms
18:58
of overall demand this is now in
19:01
exceedance of carrying capacity Westham
19:03
ate by about thirty percent on the
19:05
global basis which means that we are
19:07
beginning to deplete the natural capital
19:10
the productive fisheries forest soils
19:13
that we need to sustain future
19:15
consumption even as we're in this state
19:18
of overshoot the productivity of the
19:19
landscape is declining and hence we're
19:22
eroding our future prospects thinking of
19:27
this in an urban context now using our
19:31
methods a group under the direction of
19:33
dr. colca at Stockholm University
19:35
examined the 29 largest cities in the
19:39
Baltic States of Europe that's around
19:41
the Baltic Sea so if we just average the
19:44
total land area and population of those
19:46
things and look at all of the source and
19:48
energy flows and tie these back to the
19:50
landscape it turns out that every square
19:53
kilometre that's that little tiny square
19:54
on the left hand side of urbanized land
19:57
requires 18 square kilometers of forest
20:01
in continuous production to provide the
20:04
wood fiber and paper 30 know 50 square
20:07
kilometers arable land per square
20:09
kilometre of urbanized land to produce
20:11
food for those people these are big fish
20:14
eaters so it takes 130 square kilometers
20:16
of the most productive marine
20:17
environment for every square kilometer
20:19
of those cities the blocks on the right
20:22
refer to the land requirements for the
20:24
assimilation of the waste throughput
20:26
everything that goes into an economy
20:28
comes out as waste that must be
20:30
assimilated and two different sets of
20:32
assumptions here the black is a very
20:35
conservative set the other is a bit
20:37
wanky but the point is somewhere between
20:39
600 and 1100 square kilometres of
20:42
productive biocapacity of landscape and
20:46
water escape is needed for every single
20:48
square kilometer of urbanized land in
20:50
the Baltic States and this is typical of
20:53
large high-income countries in Europe
20:57
North America and Japan now any sensible
21:01
urban ecosystem would include within its
21:04
purview the productive landscape
21:07
needed to sustain the consumptive
21:08
activity going on in the city and until
21:11
we move towards thinking of the city as
21:13
an entire self producing self-reliant
21:16
urban ecosystem that incorporates these
21:19
productive lands that we're going
21:20
nowhere our current way of developing
21:23
cities ensures that we continue to
21:25
deplete the very regions that sustain us
21:27
because we don't even know they exist
21:29
they become invisible because of the
21:31
globalization phenomena think of a city
21:35
like Tokyo which is a monstrosity it's a
21:37
wonderful place in many social and
21:40
artistic and in you know cultural
21:43
technological ways but it's not
21:46
supportable Tokyo has 33 million people
21:49
the same population of Canada Tokyo
21:53
requires to sustain itself an area that
21:56
is four point three times the area of
21:59
Japan and about 2.1 times the nation's
22:03
domestic biocapacity pen is very
22:05
productive the bottom line is that Japan
22:08
could not support its capital city on
22:11
the entire bio capacity available to it
22:14
were it cut off from global trade by
22:18
climate change in international
22:21
geopolitics which may go rainy when we
22:23
start competing for energy and resources
22:25
and so on this is an unsustainable
22:27
entity and many other cities on the
22:30
planet are following this path because
22:32
of the assumption we can always have
22:34
access to these resources wherever they
22:36
are on the planet as we exist in
22:39
complete ignorance of the fact that they
22:40
were depleting it even as we talked
22:42
about this so there are three major
22:45
vulnerabilities to cities the first is
22:47
the erosion of agricultural landscape
22:49
most cities couldn't come close to
22:51
sustaining themselves of every bit of
22:53
green area were planted to vegetable
22:55
gardens or fruit trees we need a much
22:58
larger area and that and right now we're
23:00
losing agricultural land in an
23:02
accelerating rate we've lost enough in
23:04
the last 30 or 40 years to feed all of
23:06
Europe for example and the pace is
23:08
increasing well we don't notice because
23:11
oil in the form of fertilizers
23:13
pesticides mechanized agriculture and
23:16
maintain productivity and increased it
23:18
in areas even as other areas
23:20
are being taken out of production the
23:22
problem is and this is our second
23:24
vulnerability the phenomenon of peak oil
23:27
most of the major oil fields on the
23:29
planet were discovered in the early
23:31
1960s that's when the peak of discovery
23:34
occurred in the early 1980s 20 years
23:37
later we passed the point at which every
23:39
year consumption increases more rapidly
23:41
than new discovery and we've reached the
23:44
point then where most people now who
23:46
studied this carefully think we've
23:48
plateaued and are about to begin a long
23:51
descent and I don't care what do you
23:53
think about solar energy wind power or
23:55
any of the available alternatives right
23:57
now I'm the guy who said we don't have
23:59
the technologies ready to go forward in
24:01
total they do not begin to replace the
24:05
energy demand of society that is
24:06
currently satisfied by fossil fuel which
24:10
is a real problem also because of the
24:12
climate thing which raises the third
24:15
vulnerability of cities the simple fact
24:19
of the matter is that cities are current
24:21
agriculture all of that depends on an
24:24
extraordinarily stable period of climate
24:26
during which the soils were formed and
24:28
the agricultural development has
24:31
occurred if Canada warms up by three
24:34
degrees and the agricultural climate
24:36
moves north that's going to move north
24:38
into the tundra the boreal forest this
24:40
is not good soil and our best soils may
24:42
not be capable of sustaining significant
24:45
productivity at any rate carbon dioxide
24:48
emissions which are driving the human
24:50
component of climate change we're by no
24:51
means the major part of climate change
24:54
but we're a major component at the
24:56
margin carbon dioxide is the driver here
24:59
and carbon dioxide emissions are rising
25:01
now much faster than the worst-case
25:04
scenario of the models and I want to
25:06
emphasize that it's true that the
25:08
climate change models are erroneous but
25:10
they're erroneous in the wrong direction
25:12
I could put up a hundred slides to
25:14
illustrate that so we've seen increases
25:17
since 2000 about thirty-five percent
25:19
ahead of projections this is what it
25:22
looks like a gain real data not a model
25:24
this is from Maui Lowell Observatory in
25:27
Hawaii the instrumentation is sensitive
25:29
enough to catch the breathing of the
25:31
earth the sawtooth pattern is these
25:34
summer and winter oscillations in the
25:37
summer plants are sucking up the carbon
25:39
dioxide in the winter it accumulates but
25:41
every winter a little more accumulates
25:43
and was taken up in the previous summer
25:44
so we have a steady increase and notice
25:47
that the increase is increasing from one
25:50
point three parts per million in
25:51
nineteen seventy two seventy nine to two
25:53
point three parts and double the rate of
25:55
increase in co2 emissions or
25:57
accumulations is doubly and it has a
25:59
corresponding impact on climate again
26:02
it's our jagged picture but the trend is
26:05
clear and upward and notice in
26:07
particular that between nineteen forty
26:09
in nineteen eighty it was actually
26:11
seemingly cooling so the fact that we're
26:13
in a two or three-year cooling period
26:15
right now not cooling the slower rates
26:16
of warming doesn't mean it's over it
26:18
means that the climate is very erratic
26:22
and it will start ticking up again on
26:25
certain circumstances of and got time to
26:26
describe to you take hole now here's the
26:30
real kicker the most recent studies and
26:33
this was just reaffirmed this week by
26:35
the Hadley center in in the UK suggests
26:38
that we are going to have one hell of a
26:39
time restraining carbon dioxide
26:42
emissions below six hundred and fifty
26:45
parts per million note here that we're
26:48
already approaching 400 parts per
26:50
million the safe level over on the far
26:52
left is 300 parts per million and now
26:54
we're saying signs that because of the
26:56
unanticipated uptick in this that we're
26:59
unlikely to reconcile below six hundred
27:03
and fifty parts per million six hundred
27:04
and fifty parts per million means about
27:07
a fifty percent chance of a 4-degree or
27:10
greater global warming now that is an
27:14
astronomical change in global climate in
27:18
order to avoid this we need to begin
27:20
reducing our emissions remember I said
27:22
the only thing that counts is an
27:23
absolute reduction by about six percent
27:26
per year and accelerating thereafter in
27:29
the OECD countries no country on earth
27:32
is coming close to policy that would
27:35
even remotely approach this kind of
27:37
target so again if the science is
27:40
correct we are condemning ourselves to a
27:42
4-degree world and this is what a
27:45
4-degree world what's I mean four degree
27:46
warmer in mean global temperature all of
27:49
the yellow and brown areas are
27:51
essentially uninhabitable landscape and
27:53
you'll notice that includes India China
27:56
most of Africa that's about three
27:58
billion people right there a good part
28:00
of South American about half the United
28:02
States the only places that come out
28:04
ahead in terms of temperature at any
28:06
rate are canada and russia and they will
28:09
be asked to accommodate the three
28:10
billion other people who can no longer
28:12
live in their territory so this is not
28:14
just around you know we're in a
28:16
bliss bubble if you think that you know
28:19
green lead whatever is going to make any
28:21
difference at all it's just growing us
28:24
more efficiently and there's no
28:27
particular virtue in becoming more
28:29
efficiently unsustainable that's what
28:32
this message is all about so get ready
28:37
for it because we've had a shipload of
28:39
people land on the coast here that's
28:41
just a little preview of what might be
28:43
happening in 50 years when hundreds of
28:46
millions of people are displaced from
28:48
coastal communities from agricultural
28:50
lands that are abandoned because there's
28:52
no water or the soil has otherwise been
28:54
depleted and so on there are dozens of
28:58
studies you never read about in the news
29:00
that talk about these consequences here
29:02
are quotes from two of them the age of
29:04
consequences we predict an inevitable
29:06
scenario in which people and nations are
29:08
threatened by etc I won't read these but
29:11
the point is why aren't we paying
29:13
attention these are high-powered
29:15
high-paid the studies of the social
29:17
consequences of global change what we
29:20
mean or what this all boils down to and
29:23
again keep in mind i'm assuming the
29:25
sciences right i'm assuming we want to
29:27
survive the only thing we need to think
29:30
about is how do we reduce our absolute
29:33
contribution to the drivers here and
29:37
again it goes way back to an
29:39
International Business Council on
29:41
sustainable development meeting in
29:43
Antwerp in 1993 that said look the data
29:47
suggests even then that it's a ninety
29:49
percent reduction in energy and material
29:52
throughput in rich countries because in
29:54
order to create the ecological space in
29:57
my terminology the Eco footprints of the
29:59
rich
29:59
have already appropriated most of the
30:01
bio capacity of the planet to make room
30:03
for those the UN last week announced
30:06
that officially now 1 billion people are
30:09
in starvation badly malnourished it's
30:12
the largest number ever in the history
30:13
of the planet and more people who were
30:15
alive then we're alive when Malthus
30:17
wrote his original essay that's the
30:20
situation we're facing and we aren't
30:23
conscious of it because it's it's over
30:25
there somewhere but they say a ninety
30:27
percent reduction our ecological
30:28
footprint work says that if we're going
30:31
to have sustainability with equity on a
30:34
single planet that is shrinking then we
30:36
in North America should be working now
30:38
to devise the social safety nets the
30:42
structural change is necessary to bring
30:44
our per capita eco footprints down from
30:46
an average of nine in North America to
30:49
about two per capita now cities have a
30:53
huge leg up in doing this I'm a great
30:55
fan of density it was somewhat behind
30:57
the Eco density a movement in Vancouver
31:00
here advising the mayor with one a group
31:03
of my students on how we might conceive
31:05
of that I know some of you have
31:06
difficulty with the equity aspects of it
31:08
but that can be taken a care of the
31:11
point is there's all kinds of economies
31:13
of scale and agglomeration economies
31:15
that emerge from higher density these
31:18
slides are freely available to anyone
31:20
who wants them so I'm not going to read
31:21
this but we need to go further
31:23
efficiency is not enough all the eco
31:26
density stuff is efficiency oriented we
31:29
really need to rethink the city as the
31:31
human ecosystem we need to reconsider to
31:36
incorporate as much of their support of
31:38
ecosystems within their own political
31:40
jurisdictions as is possible if you know
31:43
that you are dependent on that acre you
31:45
will not permit unwarranted greenfield
31:49
development on that acre we are paving
31:52
over the Fraser Valley despite the land
31:55
reserved because we assume we can always
31:58
import our food from elsewhere the
32:00
elsewhere is mostly California which if
32:03
you speak to people from California are
32:05
now saying we may not have any
32:06
agriculture in 50 years at the rate the
32:09
water is a drying up they've had to shut
32:11
down tens of thousands
32:12
hectares this year because there is no
32:14
water we have a very very limited view
32:17
of our own sustainability if we continue
32:20
to think we can continue to intersect
32:22
parasitize other places simply because
32:24
we have the money to do so so we have
32:27
conceptual model bio regionalism
32:29
learning to live more or less off the
32:31
land base in your region permaculture
32:34
which would double the productivity of
32:36
our land base without go having to
32:38
resort to chemical pesticides and
32:41
fertilizers and all of that sort of
32:43
thing so I'm thinking we really have to
32:46
think 50 years ahead in terms of rican
32:49
saving the city as an urban centered
32:52
eco-city state the provinces are
32:56
obsolete the Canadian Constitution makes
32:58
no reference to communities to cities
33:00
it's provinces in the federal government
33:03
but most of us now live in cities why
33:06
not reorganize our settlements so that
33:09
they are in charge of a significant
33:11
resource base in their vicinity wouldn't
33:13
work for a place like Tokyo Tokyo needs
33:16
other kinds of arrangement but Canada
33:18
parts of the United States are capable
33:19
of thinking this way this is really
33:21
going outside of the box so that we can
33:24
claim this urban system as a complete
33:28
self-referencing self-producing
33:30
self-sustaining self-supporting entity
33:32
that is not depend so much on other
33:34
places it doesn't mean no trade because
33:37
if we have a network of these kinds of
33:38
interdependent regions they can exchange
33:41
but they exchange in terms of true
33:43
ecological surpluses and that's where we
33:46
should be going and it's actually an old
33:48
idea going back to some of the great
33:49
planners Patrick get its Lewis Mumford
33:52
Ebenezer Howard and so on now a lot of
33:55
people say God that buggers suit you
33:57
know depressing and listen this is the
34:02
good news and I just want to take you
34:04
through so I'm saying the science looks
34:10
good to me because it's just unfolding
34:12
exactly as we've said it would all along
34:15
so if we stay the course in other words
34:17
business as usual we're going to get
34:20
accelerated resource depletion
34:21
accelerating global change climate k
34:23
us greater systemic pollution economic
34:26
uncertainty hey we've had a lot of great
34:27
economic stuff a coming out of
34:29
mainstream recently a widening income
34:31
gap which is steadily happening all over
34:33
the planet including in our own country
34:35
increasing civil unrest potential
34:37
geopolitical chaos and possible cultural
34:40
collapse now there's a really neat
34:42
scenario for you and it comes right out
34:44
of doing nothing which is what most of
34:46
our politicians would like to have us do
34:49
on the other hand if we take seriously
34:51
the science and move toward an eco
34:53
transformation of sorts we might get
34:55
conservation and restoration of the
34:57
essential natural capital we need to
34:59
sustain ourselves agricultural soils
35:01
forests water supplies and so on and so
35:03
forth we would have cleaner air soil and
35:06
water we would have a higher degree of
35:08
economic security because we would plan
35:10
social safety net so the people who are
35:12
being displaced from such sunset
35:14
industries into more sustainable forms
35:16
of development have that transition
35:18
support from the rest of the community
35:19
we need to recreate community as a
35:22
message that's coming across here which
35:25
means narrowing the income gap we need
35:27
greater social capital and sense of
35:29
community greater political geopolitical
35:31
stability see down this path on the Left
35:34
we're going to be at war within 40 years
35:37
over the declining resource base it's
35:39
already beginning to appear in such
35:42
things as Iraq and where we Afghanistan
35:46
and so on so we need to move towards the
35:50
right because the pressures are real and
35:53
we'll be better off for it so again this
35:57
is the good news story the political
36:01
conundrum is the following we can't
36:04
muster the will to move toward eco
36:07
transformation and it has to do with
36:09
cognitive dissonance something else that
36:11
no locate mentioned human beings evolved
36:14
such that as a person develops
36:16
individually in a society we take on the
36:19
baggage of that society the political
36:22
ideologies the ways of thinking you know
36:24
Cartesian dualism I spoke about at the
36:26
middle and it actually helps to shape
36:28
synaptic circuitry in the brain and once
36:31
that's in place it's very difficult to
36:33
shift out of it NOLA Kate mentioned we
36:35
don't like change
36:36
well this is why we don't like change
36:38
it's in a sense hardwired via individual
36:40
development and once it's hardwired we
36:43
seek out experience does it reinforce
36:45
what we already think that's why most of
36:46
you are in this room by the way and we
36:49
avoid deny or otherwise denigrate
36:52
anything we don't want to hear about and
36:54
that's how we act so we're always
36:57
resistant to change because if it worked
36:59
from my grandfather it worked for me and
37:02
by the way that was an adaptive strategy
37:04
3,000 years ago if you survived in a
37:07
tribal circumstances because they were
37:08
doing something right better to take on
37:11
that burden but now it doesn't work
37:13
because the very circumstances that we
37:15
have created comes from thinking that is
37:19
destructive and if we take on that
37:21
thinking we'll just carry on down this
37:23
path we really need to shift the problem
37:26
is what's ecologically necessary is
37:28
politically unfeasible but what's
37:30
politically feasible look at what we're
37:32
doing in this country are going to
37:33
climate policy is ecologically
37:35
irrelevant and will get us nowhere so be
37:38
the change if someone has already said
37:40
and by the way good luck thanks very
37:43
much
