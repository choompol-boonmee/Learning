- Phil we wanted to learn how
00:43
advertisers capture our attention and
00:45
get us to buy stuff we don't even really
00:47
need so we turned to Jonas Sachs
00:49
an advertising executive and co-founder
00:52
of free-range studios to explain a few
00:54
ways brands get into our heads
00:56
how do ads tell us who we are or give us
00:59
tell us who we should be we see 3,500 of
01:02
them a day and the majority of them
01:04
basically tell us you suck and if you
01:06
don't buy this product you're not going
01:07
to be rich enough smart enough hot
01:09
enough and so we walk around being told
01:12
3,500 times a day how deficient and lame
01:14
we are are there an additive stuck out
01:19
in your mind the number-one most shared
01:22
advertisement on YouTube of all time in
01:24
that dub real beauty sketches add they
01:26
make the real beauty sketches it's all
01:27
about how women are so much more
01:28
beautiful than they think they are
01:30
through the stunt of a police artist
01:32
who's sketching them tell me about your
01:34
hair they make a picture of what they
01:36
think they look like which is what a
01:37
stranger things kind of have a fat
01:38
rounder face people are saying listen
01:40
they're reaching hundreds of millions of
01:41
people with a positive message about
01:43
beauty people want to share they say oh
01:44
those are my values that's my idea and
01:46
then you start buying the soap because
01:48
you share this value
01:50
No
01:55
so this is one of those classic shop
01:58
therapy ads that you know parent to it
02:01
is hard drinking coke is easy
02:05
you need to speak to people and level of
02:07
identity to speak people on level of
02:09
emotion there are millions of people
02:10
we're going to sit there and be like
02:11
yeah that's my truth that's it it's
02:13
totally me
02:14
thanks coke why use Beckham
02:20
advertisements tell you not that this
02:24
product does this thing it's that people
02:25
like this use this product if you want
02:28
to be like these kind of people use this
02:30
product and you're instantly one of them
02:31
you know we all want heroes in our lives
02:33
and we want to know how to be more like
02:34
those heroes and you know watching
02:36
sports and watching movies that these
02:39
guys are in we don't necessarily know
02:40
how to be more like them but
02:41
advertisements tell us how to be are you
02:43
up for whatever don't answer
02:44
grab a Bud Light and chilli try new
02:48
things make new friends it means all
02:51
just crafted around creating a gap you
02:54
know you don't have enough you don't
02:56
have what's right it's not necessarily
02:58
even at the audience of the sitting at
02:59
home and saying oh man I need spend more
03:01
time in the club it's like saying
03:02
they're saying everybody else is in the
03:04
club and why aren't you there so
03:06
advertising is just a constant fear of
03:07
missing out there's a huge amount of
03:09
that well
03:11
advertisers are like crappy friends they
03:14
make us feel needy ugly and uncool but
03:17
we keep him around anyway this is a
03:19
beautiful moment sure could use a coke
03:23
