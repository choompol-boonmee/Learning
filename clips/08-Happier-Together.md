https://youtu.be/ux2pPxQ2PNs


00:06
good evening everybody very very warm
00:09
welcome to you all to this very special
00:13
evening
00:14
I'm delighted we'll be joined and are
00:16
joined on screen now by Professor Robert
00:19
Walden from Harvard Medical School Bob
00:23
it's lovely to see you again thank you
00:24
so much for being here first of all it's
00:27
lovely to be here in a afternoon in
00:30
Boston well welcome and I can see
00:34
already we have thousands of people
00:35
who've joined us on this zoom webinar
00:39
and I'd be many more watching live on on
00:42
Facebook too so a very warm welcome to
00:46
all of you who have joined us this
00:49
evening the series event is entitled
00:53
happier together and we will come on to
00:55
this idea that I think is the Baba's
00:59
done so much wonderful work on around
01:02
the importance of our relationships for
01:04
our happiness but we're going to have a
01:05
more expansive conversation on that this
01:07
evening and touch on a range of themes
01:09
to do with happiness and living a good
01:12
life but to do with our connections with
01:14
each other and how we can build a better
01:16
world together it's incredibly topical
01:18
right now with all the challenges of all
01:20
is facing and Bob really has a unique
01:24
perspective on this whole topic through
01:27
the amazing study that he is director of
01:29
which has been following the lives of
01:32
people for I think 75 years now I'll let
01:35
Bob say more about it we had this
01:37
amazing insight into what is it that
01:39
predicts a good life and I'm looking
01:42
forward to exploring that with you Bob
01:43
this evening so before I hand over to
01:47
you and we get started just to give
01:48
people who are joining now a bit of a
01:50
sense of what's in store we're gonna
01:53
start as you've kindly offered to lead
01:55
us in a bit of a meditation exercise to
01:57
help us tune into how we're feeling
01:59
about all this right now and so maybe
02:01
allow us to deal with some of the things
02:03
that we're all dealing with it's a
02:04
difficult time for many people right now
02:06
so we'll start with a moment of pause
02:08
and reflection and then I'm just gonna
02:10
guide us through a few themes and topics
02:13
which I know you have great expertise on
02:16
and I hope
02:16
of great interest to the audience as
02:19
well looking at what creates our
02:22
happiness but also relationships the
02:24
current situation in the world some of
02:26
the challenges we face and maybe ways
02:28
that we can put all this into action for
02:30
ourselves and our own lives but also for
02:33
the people we care about so really
02:34
looking forward to getting your
02:36
perspectives on that and then of course
02:38
folks tuning in there'll also be time
02:40
for your questions so you'll see if
02:43
you're if you're new to zoom have a look
02:45
down and you'll see there's a Q&A option
02:47
on screen and so if you do want to pose
02:50
a question unfortunate we definitely
02:51
won't have time to take all of your
02:52
questions but we'd love to put some of
02:55
the questions live to Bob this evening
02:58
and we'll leave time for that and I can
02:59
already see that hundreds of people are
03:01
joining in on the chat function as part
03:03
of zoom so do if you'd like to get
03:06
involved with that there's always a
03:07
lovely conversation in these webinars
03:08
but equally if you finding it
03:10
distracting please feel free to to close
03:12
the chat window on your device so that
03:14
you can focus on what Bob is sharing
03:16
with us so we have a great turnout
03:19
already I can see thousands have joined
03:20
us so I'll leave the introduction there
03:23
and and really invite you Bob to get us
03:26
set for this evening's conversation
03:28
really you've kindly offered to lead a
03:31
certain meditation maybe you'd like to
03:32
introduce that in whatever way seems
03:34
most appropriate to you I'm happy to
03:37
first of all it is a thrill to be here
03:40
and watching all the chatting that's
03:43
going on is pretty exciting it's a
03:45
reflection of this community that I'm
03:47
learning more and more about in action
03:50
for happiness so really great to be here
03:53
so I I am a Zen practitioner I have
04:00
practiced Zen now for many years
04:02
meditation
04:03
I teach Zen and it's been a hugely
04:07
helpful part of my life but I think for
04:11
many of us it's not obvious why paying
04:16
attention to the present moment which is
04:20
what meditation is why that would be
04:22
helpful and so what I thought I would do
04:27
if you are willing is to ask you to
04:30
join me in a meditation exercise that
04:34
might just help give you a taste of what
04:38
I'm talking about
04:40
of how how actually paying attention in
04:44
the present moment could relieve
04:46
suffering right now so first here's my
04:52
challenge would you all be willing to
04:54
shut off the chat function right now
04:57
just for a minute because I don't want
04:59
you to have any other distractions now
05:01
obviously that's completely voluntary
05:02
but if you would because we're
05:06
constantly giving each other partial
05:09
attention and so I'm wondering if you'd
05:11
be willing to come into full attention
05:13
with me right now and then do this
05:17
exercise with me and then you can go
05:20
right back to chatting or whatever you
05:22
want to do so here's the exercise I'd
05:28
like you to sit comfortably where you
05:32
are and if you're comfortable with it
05:35
close your eyes if you're not
05:39
comfortable with that it's fine to leave
05:41
your eyes open sit very still and think
05:48
about something that's recently been
05:52
bothering you think about a worry or
05:59
something that angered you or somebody
06:02
who annoyed you or perhaps somebody who
06:05
hurt you or something really upsetting
06:09
in our world that's gotten to you
06:12
personally think about that for a moment
06:29
let yourself feel it let the thoughts
06:32
really swirl and develop and let the
06:35
feelings just come up
06:55
and now I'd like you to let those
06:57
upsetting thoughts be there don't push
07:01
them away
07:04
let the upsetting feelings be there
07:06
don't try to stop them and now expand
07:12
your awareness to include how your body
07:15
feels
07:18
notice what breathing in feels like
07:22
breathing out
07:26
notice if you're having any muscle
07:28
tension right now and where that is
07:34
you might hear the sound of blood
07:36
pulsing through your ears notice any
07:40
physical sensation that comes to you
07:53
so now again don't push the upsetting
07:58
thoughts and feelings away but expand
08:01
your awareness a second time so the
08:08
thoughts may still be there and you're
08:11
aware of some body sensations and now
08:15
include any sounds that there might be
08:18
in the room or the feel of the air on
08:23
your skin or the sound of traffic
08:25
outside or birds whatever sounds and
08:31
feelings reach you
08:50
so now what I'd like you to do is notice
08:54
the difference between those upsetting
08:57
thoughts and feelings when we began and
09:03
how they seemed to you net and now if
09:12
your eyes were closed please open them
09:16
so what we did was we just started with
09:20
where our minds are most of our waking
09:23
lives we're thinking about worries we're
09:27
thinking about plans what's wrong what's
09:30
next thing and sometimes what's happy
09:33
and what's pleasurable but we as humans
09:37
typically focus on the content of our
09:39
minds to almost the total exclusion of
09:43
everything else think of the times for
09:47
example that you've been lost in thought
09:49
as you've been traveling to a familiar
09:50
destination to the office or to a
09:53
friend's house that we're so often on
09:56
autopilot so this moving through life on
10:02
autopilot endlessly involved with our
10:06
internal monologue is a large part of
10:09
what makes us feel trapped in our own
10:12
skulls so what I did just now is I
10:17
deliberately asked you to focus on
10:19
something that was unpleasant because
10:21
those things are especially riveting
10:24
they draw our attention and then they
10:28
ask you to expand your awareness to your
10:31
body to tune into those sensations that
10:35
are always there and available to us
10:37
breathing heartbeat but that we
10:40
typically screen out it's a whole
10:42
humming vibrating ever-changing universe
10:45
of experience that mostly we screen it
10:48
and then finally I asked you to expand
10:53
your awareness to what's around you to
10:55
the room to the sounds that might be
10:57
outside so now if those max
11:03
troubling thoughts and feelings that you
11:05
started with are still there they're not
11:08
occupying center stage in quite the same
11:11
way and life feels bigger than that
11:16
particular problem that I got you to
11:19
start thinking about what we did was to
11:24
DS Center from the content of our
11:26
thoughts we don't push thinking away we
11:31
don't try to get rid of thoughts or
11:32
feelings in fact the more you try to get
11:35
rid of anything going through your mind
11:37
the more your mind will be abuzz with
11:40
thinking about that we just expanded our
11:44
awareness to include more and more of
11:46
what's present right here in the moment
11:51
there's an analogy to this that I like a
11:53
lot it's like taking a teaspoon of salt
11:58
and putting it in a tea cup full of
12:00
water and mixing it up and if you do
12:03
that the water tastes very salty but
12:08
then if you pour that tea cup full of
12:10
water into a gallon of water and mix it
12:13
up the water tastes much less salty and
12:17
then if you did the same thing again and
12:20
poured that gallon of water into a
12:22
bathtub full of water and tasted that
12:24
water you would hardly taste the salt at
12:27
all it's the same amount of salt it's
12:31
the same amount of trouble and upset but
12:36
no longer taking over most of our
12:39
awareness and that's how paying
12:43
attention in the moment and expanding
12:46
awareness can relieve suffering right
12:49
here right now in any moment always
12:52
available to us so thank thank you for
12:57
letting me take you through that now
13:00
you're free to turn on the chat function
13:01
again if you want but hopefully you'll
13:05
also spend some time talking with mark
13:09
and me about what we'd like to share
13:11
with you well thank you Bob that was a
13:13
very moving exercise I found that
13:15
incredibly helpful
13:17
did indeed alleviate a cause of anxiety
13:20
for me currently and putting it sort of
13:22
into context of what else is going on
13:25
around me I'd like to bring us from that
13:27
really lovely centering and beginning of
13:29
this chapter to really invite you to
13:32
share perhaps there's the central thesis
13:34
of your work which some of the audience
13:35
will have seen in your amazing TED talk
13:38
there's reached millions of people but I
13:41
wonder if you wanted to share you know a
13:42
little bit of the context about the
13:43
amazing study you've been doing
13:45
following people's lives and perhaps
13:46
some of the most important messages that
13:48
have come out of that sure this this is
13:53
as far as we know the longest study of
13:55
adult life that's ever been done and
13:58
what's so unusual is that it followed
14:01
the same people from the time they were
14:03
teenagers all the way into old age
14:06
almost all of them have passed away now
14:09
and we've been studying their children
14:11
and we hope to study their grandchildren
14:14
and great-grandchildren but these
14:15
original people were 724 men about 2/3
14:23
of them were from Boston's poorest most
14:26
disadvantaged families and about one
14:29
third were among the most privileged
14:32
group they could find back then in 1938
14:35
a group of Harvard College sophomores so
14:40
second-year students and we followed all
14:44
of them all the way through their lives
14:48
and asked them periodically to share the
14:51
most important things about their mental
14:54
health their physical health their work
14:56
lives their family lives their
14:58
friendships their community involvement
15:01
so that's what we did and as far as we
15:03
know it's the longest study that's ever
15:05
been done and oh yes so you asked mark
15:10
to share some I guess lots of us think
15:13
about we know what would lead to a good
15:15
life but we think that if you have the
15:17
right you know education the right
15:19
income the right things the right
15:21
success sort of external achievements
15:24
that would lead to a good life is that
15:25
what you found yeah
15:27
well no not exactly I mean
15:31
we did find was that having your basic
15:34
needs met is vital right so having a
15:37
roof over your head being able to feed
15:39
yourself and your family having health
15:42
care all that is really important but
15:44
that once that is taken care of then you
15:49
no more money
15:51
becoming famous becoming super powerful
15:54
at work that just that doesn't seem to
16:00
increase happiness
16:01
much at all and that what we found the
16:05
most consistent thing we found all the
16:07
way through was that the strength of
16:12
people's friendships and relationships
16:13
with other people was the strongest
16:16
factor in keeping people not just
16:19
happier emotionally but physically
16:22
healthier and that was actually the big
16:25
surprise I mean it stands to reason that
16:28
if you have happy relationships you'll
16:30
be happier but how could it actually
16:33
keep people healthier how could it keep
16:36
you from getting heart disease or from
16:38
developing type two diabetes or
16:40
arthritis how could that happen so we've
16:43
been studying that now for the last 15
16:47
20 years so powerful stuff and really
16:53
insightful I guess it takes me towards a
16:57
situation with finding ourselves in
17:00
currently in the world Bob so you know I
17:04
think your your your workers found that
17:08
relationships are really important for a
17:10
good life and togetherness and that
17:13
sense of feeling connected to others and
17:16
yet here we are in their in their global
17:18
crisis is affecting the whole human
17:20
family where people are really
17:23
struggling in many ways we're socially
17:25
isolating that awful term sort of being
17:27
distant from each other there were many
17:28
people who are shielding and staying
17:29
away what is some of your reflections on
17:33
you know how the the findings of your
17:36
work and particularly around the
17:37
importance of relationships play out in
17:39
this very difficult situation we're in
17:41
in the moment
17:44
such an important issue for all of us
17:46
and what I'm finding both from our
17:52
research and from just talking with
17:54
people and from my own family and
17:55
friends is that our lives have been
17:59
frozen suddenly we've been frozen in
18:02
place in a way so that we can't connect
18:06
with some of the people that we're used
18:08
to being able to see every day or every
18:11
week whenever we want to those people we
18:16
see at work or those friends we go for a
18:19
drink with after work or play sports
18:23
with so we can't see those people and at
18:26
the same time we're home 24/7 with
18:31
people who we don't usually stay home
18:33
with all the time uh school-age children
18:35
who were used to sending off to school
18:37
every day or to childcare we're not with
18:41
our spouses or our significant others
18:43
every day 24/7 in fact we never signed
18:48
up for that I mean most of us when we
18:50
got together with our partners didn't
18:52
say I'll be with you 24 hours a day
18:55
seven days a week for weeks on end we
18:57
never did that so so I think what we're
19:00
seeing is both enforced isolation and
19:04
separation from people who we need and
19:07
want to be with and then also some
19:09
enforced contact sometimes without
19:13
enough of a break and I'd be happy to
19:17
talk to each of those things if that
19:19
would be abuse mark or you know but I'm
19:22
finding that there are these kind of two
19:24
extremes that that we need to think
19:27
about and manage well I think that's
19:30
your observations are very well taken
19:32
and I think there were so many
19:33
challenges coming out of this situation
19:35
I wonder if perhaps we might move
19:37
towards looking at what some other ways
19:39
we can enhance our connections that
19:40
relationships are and then maybe we
19:42
could revisit how that's particularly
19:44
applicable or challenging right now sir
19:47
perhaps it may be stepping away from the
19:49
crisis for a moment what would you say
19:51
in your experience and in the
19:53
again looking at the studies you've done
19:55
are some of the most important ways that
19:57
we can in recognizing that our
19:59
relationships really Drive lifelong and
20:01
health and happiness what more can we do
20:04
to cultivate your relationships in
20:05
general terms yeah yeah you know one of
20:10
the things I always used to think was
20:12
that relationships would just kind of
20:15
take care of themselves so I made a
20:17
friend or I got together with a partner
20:20
and then we were all set right and they
20:23
would they would just go on like that
20:25
and what we've learned in our research
20:28
and what other research shows us is that
20:31
actually relationships don't just take
20:33
care of themselves that they require
20:36
constant tending and nurturing so very
20:41
common that really good relationships
20:44
let's say marriages for example are off
20:48
to a good start and then the kids come
20:50
along and then the couple is a good
20:53
tag-team and they take care of the kids
20:55
but they actually don't spend any time
20:57
together anymore and they start being
21:00
more of a you know a work team rather
21:04
than an intimate relationship similarly
21:08
with friends where people find that as
21:11
they get older those friends you made
21:14
those childhood friends are those
21:15
friends from school with they fall away
21:20
not because there's anything wrong in
21:22
the friendships but because we don't
21:24
actively make the time to tend to them
21:26
we don't call each other up
21:27
we don't say in the in the non pandemic
21:31
times we don't say let's get together
21:33
for coffee let's go take a walk together
21:36
we just don't do that we say well I'm
21:38
gonna spend time this afternoon doing my
21:40
email because I need to get it done so I
21:43
think what we've been learning from our
21:46
research is that there is there's
21:49
something I like to call social fitness
21:51
it's almost like physical fitness where
21:53
you don't say well I worked out today so
21:56
I'm done I don't need to work out ever
21:58
again that that when we think about
22:00
tending to relationships they need it we
22:03
need to really think about well which
22:05
friends
22:06
am I not seeing and and who do I want to
22:09
be in touch with and and what do I want
22:12
to do this Saturday afternoon do I want
22:16
to spend my time on my computer or do I
22:20
want to call up a friend and take a walk
22:24
even a socially distanced walk with
22:26
masks on is possible so so what I guess
22:29
might might that's a long answer to
22:32
saying that actively taking the
22:35
initiative to attend to relationships is
22:38
is the way to keep them vibrant and to
22:42
keep good relationships from becoming
22:44
stale indeed and you mentioned this idea
22:48
of social distancing I find that term
22:51
frustrating in some ways because well of
22:53
course we want its physical distancing
22:55
to keep our health risks at bay during
22:57
the crisis but we want to stay socially
22:59
connected and my colleague Vanessa King
23:02
our psychology expert that a lovely
23:04
webinar so it's a live stream earlier
23:06
talking about listening as a vital sort
23:10
of way of staying connected and you know
23:12
heartfelt listening and really
23:13
connecting people have you found that is
23:15
that an example do you think of some of
23:17
what you've talked about sort of
23:18
actively cultivating relationship so we
23:19
actually need to be better at hearing
23:21
each other absolutely that's a great
23:23
that is a great point because you know
23:26
if you think about it just to ask people
23:28
what's it's been like for you you know
23:31
what's it been like to be by yourself
23:33
alone in your flat or your your house
23:38
right or what's it been like to have
23:40
your kids home all day long or what's it
23:44
like to be without childcare and I think
23:46
that that so just to ask people tell me
23:49
about your experience is a way for to
23:52
help people feel more connected and then
23:55
to tell them about your experience and
23:57
that we can do you know we can do here
23:59
on zoom or we can do taking a walk and
24:02
and I like that point it's we don't want
24:05
social distancing we want physical
24:07
distancing we as we need it for health
24:10
reasons but we don't want to be socially
24:12
distanced at all physically safe but
24:15
socially connected yes thank you for
24:17
that
24:18
I guess you touched on
24:20
really about the idea of asking somebody
24:21
especially if they're in a difficult
24:22
situation they're feeling lonely
24:25
isolated at home of course there are
24:26
many people not only struggling right
24:29
now in the crisis but also that might
24:30
feel quite disconnected generally I mean
24:33
it's not all of us that have the luxury
24:35
of a loving spouse or partner family at
24:39
home there are many people increase in
24:40
fact increasing numbers of people living
24:42
alone feeling lonely disconnected and
24:44
people who may not be extroverted may
24:46
not naturally want to form a lot of
24:48
face-to-face connections are there ways
24:50
in which you can still help people
24:52
cultivate your relationships even if
24:54
they're feeling a bit sort of socially
24:56
isolated yes yes one way is that we can
25:00
help those peoples so we all know people
25:03
who are socially isolated and they may
25:07
not be reaching out to us the either
25:11
because they're more isolated and they
25:13
tend not to do that or because they
25:15
can't for some reason so when you think
25:18
of somebody who you think may be more
25:21
alone than they want to be reach out to
25:24
them if the thought crosses your mind do
25:26
something about it don't think I'll do
25:29
that later
25:29
unless it's 3:00 in the morning in which
25:31
case do that later but but other than
25:33
that reach out take that moment when the
25:36
thought occurs to you and then I think
25:38
for the people who are more alone now if
25:44
you can some of us feel more comfortable
25:48
than others just reaching out and saying
25:50
hi how are you and there are kind of
25:54
low-threshold ways to do that now where
25:56
you could just send a quick text or a
25:59
quick email and and send it to everybody
26:02
you can think of and then see who comes
26:04
back to you so there are some it doesn't
26:09
even take a lot of courage to send an
26:11
email or write a text for many people in
26:14
the way that it might take to to make a
26:16
call on the telephone if you're not sure
26:18
you're going to catch somebody at a good
26:20
time so I think that the encouragement
26:23
for people who are alone is to try to
26:27
reach out but then the encouragement for
26:29
those of us who know them is to really
26:33
be active
26:34
and reaching out to them thank you very
26:38
very wise words Bob so this sort of
26:41
leads I think into a broader question
26:43
for me about the the situation we find
26:46
ourselves in collectively not just in
26:48
this current crisis but some of the
26:50
trends we're seeing in society there's
26:53
almost sort of two competing now tips
26:55
about humans and how we are together
26:57
there's one that's very much about a
26:59
common humanity we're all in this
27:00
together and actually one of the rather
27:02
encouraging things at the start of the
27:04
crisis at least for the sense of what
27:05
we're facing a common threat all this
27:07
lovely outgoing of kindness people
27:09
getting in what's up groups in their
27:11
communities a newfound sense of
27:12
togetherness and yet on the other hand
27:14
we have and have had for some years now
27:16
increasingly in the West I sort of sense
27:18
of a more polarized way of being an
27:21
us-versus-them if you either in my
27:24
in-group or you're not that sort of
27:27
sense of animosity and of course as
27:29
we're coming out of this crisis people
27:30
have different levels of tolerance for
27:32
risk some people are very gung-ho some
27:34
people are very nervous and we're
27:35
starting to feel a little bit like an
27:37
us-and-them narrative is is creeping
27:39
back in so I guess both both in the
27:42
current context but also more generally
27:43
how important is it that we do nurture
27:46
that narrative of togetherness and what
27:48
can we do to sort of bring that out more
27:50
at a time of increasing sort of
27:53
polarization of different groups I think
27:57
that is like the central question for
28:00
all of us right now you know if we look
28:03
at how we humans have done throughout
28:06
the course of history when we divide
28:09
ourselves off from each other we end up
28:11
suffering we make wars on each other we
28:14
key we demonize each other we caused a
28:17
lot of hurt and when we recognize the
28:21
fact that we are really all in this
28:23
together we're all on this planet
28:25
together we're all in this pandemic
28:27
together then cooperation is possible
28:30
then there's feet less infection fewer
28:32
people die we're able to open up our
28:36
societies again sooner like all that
28:38
happens if we pull together and we pull
28:41
in a United Way so actually the
28:43
fragmentation and the division has
28:47
in the way of exactly the thing that
28:50
people are most upset about and say they
28:53
needed which is to be back having their
28:55
freedoms again the more we pull together
28:57
the more the more what the sooner we'll
29:00
be able to have those freedoms so so I
29:03
guess my my urging is that any time
29:09
someone tries to divide us from each
29:12
other we turn away from those messages
29:14
and anytime somebody uses language and
29:18
speaks to us about being in this
29:21
together and acting that way those are
29:24
the people we want to turn toward and
29:26
those are the people we want to listen
29:28
to and we really do have a choice there
29:33
that's that's very wise advice and
29:36
something that's very actionable because
29:37
I think we can often feel that visceral
29:39
response to is this creating a sort of
29:42
toxic interaction or sort of
29:44
constructive way of responding I was
29:46
very moved by something you said in your
29:48
TED talk actually in the context of
29:50
personal relationship but it was about
29:52
how people who have to the generally
29:55
loving and nurturing relationships are
29:57
so that's protective for their health if
29:59
you're in a sort of I think what you've
30:00
got a high conflict relationship where
30:02
there's more animosity and so on that's
30:04
just generally detrimental for for
30:06
health and in a very productive way
30:08
presumably that's also true at a
30:10
societal level is that right that are
30:12
some of the more sort of toxic
30:14
interactions we have it's bad for all of
30:16
our well-being is that your observation
30:18
absolutely absolutely and I can say this
30:20
as a clinician as a psychiatrist that
30:24
people people who I have seen for a long
30:27
time are coming in more upset more
30:29
stressed and starting to have more
30:31
physical health problems even though the
30:36
stresses are not primarily from say
30:38
within their their families or their
30:41
individual worlds it is the stress of
30:43
the environment now that's taking a toll
30:46
on all of us and so what I would say is
30:50
that we are all going to be physically
30:52
healthier the more we calm down this
30:55
inflammation of our differences and it's
30:59
easy to unfortunately we humans
31:01
have this quality to our minds that it's
31:04
easy to get us all excited about our
31:07
differences and help us find enemies
31:09
that's just the way we're built so we
31:11
have to kind of actively counter them
31:13
but the health the health benefits are
31:16
very clear of reducing their stress that
31:18
comes with social divisions so here's a
31:23
challenge to that and that we might
31:26
experience for those of us that really
31:27
care about this mission which is there
31:30
were many things in our world we want to
31:31
put right we might be passionate about
31:33
climate change challenges or racial
31:37
injustice or some some other societal
31:40
you know situation that needs to be
31:42
rectified we're angry we want to see
31:44
change so how can we use those desires
31:48
to change and make things better that
31:49
are coming from a good place but do
31:51
involve an anger in a and I sort of
31:52
confrontational nature in a constructive
31:54
way bearing in mind all that you've said
31:56
how can we be both compassionate and
31:58
connective but also to stand up for what
32:00
we believe in right right
32:02
so I just want to call out a quote a
32:05
famous quote from the Buddha he said you
32:08
know 2500 years ago he said hate never
32:11
quelled hate only love quells hate so I
32:18
am passionate about saving our planet I
32:23
care deeply about that and I know that
32:26
there are people who think that that's
32:28
all a hoax and not something we need to
32:30
worry about and that it's far more
32:32
important to worry about our economy and
32:36
the fact is that we have to find ways
32:39
where it doesn't become either/or
32:43
we have to find ways where we take care
32:46
of people who are suffering as we work
32:52
for climate change and we shut down coal
32:54
mines so if we do that we have to take
32:57
care of coal miners and their families
32:58
and we have to have not just compassion
33:01
but we have to do real things to make
33:03
sure that those people are ok and have
33:07
what they need right so we have to do we
33:09
have to work for climate change I want
33:11
to work to shut down climate emissions
33:14
but at the same
33:15
time I've got to take action to take
33:19
care of and have compassion for the
33:22
people who are being affected because
33:24
change change is hard and change affects
33:27
all of us and some of us get hurt by it
33:30
and so we have to try to take care of
33:32
each other and mitigate that hurt
33:36
thank you very much agree with that
33:40
we've talked there a lot to think about
33:42
the connections to others our
33:44
relationships
33:45
compassion wider societal issues and of
33:49
course there's another relationship in
33:50
all of our lives as well as with each
33:51
other it's with ourselves and there's a
33:54
phrase that I see very often online
33:56
within our community which says
33:58
something like you can't pour from an
34:00
empty cup that we can only really reach
34:02
out to have time for others to connect
34:04
with others to give to others if we also
34:05
nurture ourselves and that self-care
34:08
isn't selfish it's almost essential for
34:09
us to be the best we can be in to help
34:12
others how do you see that how do you
34:13
see that sort of lecture to self and and
34:15
how self-care helps underpin better
34:18
relationships it's really important I
34:21
see this a lot in in first responders in
34:24
health care workers now and they're just
34:26
an extremely example that all of us are
34:30
in that position where if we don't take
34:32
care of ourselves we lose energy we burn
34:35
out we can't do the things out there in
34:38
the world to help other people so but
34:41
what it means then is is being really
34:45
careful to do the things that our
34:47
grandmothers would tell us we need to do
34:50
right so we do need to eat reasonably
34:53
well we do need to make the time to get
34:56
enough sleep we do need to get exercise
34:59
but we try if we can we try not to smoke
35:02
we try not to abuse alcohol or other
35:05
substances right we really do our best
35:07
to do that because it will enable us to
35:13
help other people they did this
35:16
wonderful campaign to try to get older
35:20
women to exercise and they found that
35:24
when they scared
35:25
older women with advertisements like you
35:28
know about getting heart disease
35:29
or you know bad things happening too if
35:32
you don't get exercise it didn't get
35:34
anybody to get more exercise but when
35:36
they showed pictures of grandmothers
35:39
holding their grandbabies and say be
35:42
there for the ones who need you be sure
35:46
to take care of yourself
35:47
lots of people spent more time taking
35:50
care of themselves and so it's it's
35:52
almost as though what we need to remind
35:54
ourselves others who needs us and if we
35:57
want to be there for the people who need
35:59
us we have we have to start by taking
36:01
care of ourselves or who we just won't
36:04
be able to do it yes and we see that a
36:07
lot in our community lots of people who
36:08
do a huge amount to care for others but
36:10
actually often don't spend as much time
36:13
sort of being kind to themselves and so
36:16
I wondered if you had any tips on that
36:18
ways we can sort of nurture ourselves
36:20
more not in a sort of narcissistic way
36:22
but in a way that helps us to be the
36:25
change we want to see in the world you
36:26
share that lovely meditation with us at
36:28
the start that idea of sort of having a
36:30
sensitive presence of being aware of
36:33
what's around you as well as the
36:34
feelings you're dealing with but of
36:36
course you've studied the lives of many
36:37
people we all have had different habits
36:39
you I'm sure you have your own practices
36:40
what are some ideas you could share with
36:42
us Bob about ways we can cultivate that
36:44
sense of a good relationship with our
36:46
self as well as each other yes yes and
36:49
and you know the first thing I would say
36:53
is one size never fits all so I just led
36:57
you through a meditation exercise but
36:59
for many people meditation is not is not
37:02
something they feel good when they do
37:04
right there's no there's nothing that's
37:07
you need to be doing meditation or you
37:11
need to be doing yoga or you need to get
37:13
this kind of exercise or that what we do
37:17
know is that if you can find some way to
37:19
tune in to the bigger world around you
37:24
so that could be through prayer that
37:26
could be through playing music that that
37:30
could be through painting or doing a
37:34
sketch there's so many ways that you
37:37
just Center could be writing writing in
37:39
a journal there
37:42
so many ways that we can centre within
37:45
ourselves that then energizes us to go
37:48
forward and the way to know what works
37:50
for you is really just to check in with
37:54
yourself when you try something say do I
37:57
feel calmer do I maybe feel more
38:00
energized after that or do I feel
38:03
depleted or was it unpleasant and if it
38:08
wasn't good for you don't do that move
38:10
on to something else find what works I
38:14
love that and it's what I would sort of
38:17
describe as mindful living we talk about
38:19
mindfulness as a practice but of course
38:20
you're really encouraging us to tune in
38:22
and notice what's going on in us and
38:24
around us when we do different things
38:26
and to cultivate those things that help
38:28
reduce anxiety and increase calm and
38:31
compassion we've sort of getting towards
38:35
a time where I'd like to bring in some
38:36
questions from the audience you've been
38:37
waiting very patiently in raising all
38:39
kinds of wonderful things while we've
38:41
been speaking Bob but the first thing
38:43
that's come up a lot while you've been
38:44
talking is people who are just keen to
38:46
hear a bit more about your study so
38:47
first of all could you just let us know
38:49
briefly where can people find out more
38:50
about the amazing what you've been doing
38:52
yes so there are two places one is a
38:55
website called lifespan research org so
39:00
all one word life span research dot
39:04
o-r-g and then there's another rese
39:08
there's another website for the study
39:11
itself it's adult development study dot
39:16
o-r-g again all one word adult
39:19
development study and the adult
39:22
development study has some of our papers
39:25
which are you know the papers we publish
39:27
in scientific journals which are highly
39:29
technical and if you need some bedtime
39:32
reading to put you to sleep you might
39:34
want to try some of those papers but
39:36
some of you may want to see the the some
39:38
of the scientific basis behind what i'm
39:41
saying so so by all means check that huh
39:45
Thank You Bo so this there's a whole
39:48
range of different topics that have come
39:50
up but I'm going to dive into a quite a
39:51
difficult one I think here so Rachel's
39:53
raised a question about
39:54
manage the rejection and hurt that we
39:57
can sometimes be met with you know I
39:58
guess she's talking about when you reach
39:59
out to others or try and form a
40:01
relationship or friendship and you feel
40:03
rejected or hurt or somebody does
40:04
something hurtful to you how can we
40:06
respond positively and constructively to
40:08
that yeah that is such an important
40:12
question and it happens as we know it
40:14
happens a lot I mean there's not one
40:16
person alive who doesn't know what it
40:18
means to feel hurt and to feel rejected
40:21
we all do and I you know I think there
40:27
are a couple of things to point to one
40:29
is to see if you can D Center yourself
40:32
to think okay maybe this isn't about me
40:36
maybe what feels like a rejection could
40:39
be that this person is just having a
40:41
terrible day or this person just learned
40:44
that their father-in-law has cancer or
40:48
you know things that you couldn't
40:50
possibly know about so remember that
40:52
there are many possibilities for why you
40:54
get a negative response from someone
40:57
our first tendency is to say this is
40:59
about me and and you have to remember
41:02
that very often that's not the case that
41:05
it isn't about you and then the thing is
41:09
too I think to take a breath to step
41:12
back to let the hurt pass because it
41:15
will pass that don't respond right away
41:18
don't send the angry text or email in
41:21
response it's very tempting to send
41:24
something angry back but if you can hold
41:28
yourself back don't do that but instead
41:30
take time out go away
41:32
think about it in the way I'm suggesting
41:35
take a walk sleep on it and the next day
41:38
if you still want to respond see if you
41:41
can respond in a way that has some
41:44
compassion sometimes why don't one
41:48
phrase I like is strike while the iron
41:51
is cold that don't go back while the
41:54
iron is hot well you're in the heat of
41:56
passion or the other person is angry
41:58
don't do that step away
42:00
let everything calm down see how it
42:03
looks to you after you have calmed down
42:06
and then go back to the
42:08
person who's rejected you or move on if
42:11
that's not a person you need to spend
42:14
more time with move on to people who you
42:19
know who won't respond that way yes I
42:22
find I learnt the hard way that if I
42:24
receive for example an email that makes
42:25
me angry it was better to sleep on it
42:27
and think about it at the moment
42:31
so there's a couple of questions here
42:33
which relate to the current situation
42:34
with the the crisis and social
42:36
distancing so Arjun first of all asked
42:39
would love to know your perspective on
42:40
the effects of social distancing on sort
42:43
of mental health right now but also in
42:46
the future which is I think a really
42:47
important point we may be facing a sort
42:49
of second wave of mental health
42:50
challenges as much as physical health
42:52
challenges and sort of related to that
42:54
Gemma has asked an interesting question
42:55
about relationships obviously matter but
42:58
how important is physical touch because
43:00
of course at the moment we're not able
43:01
to so we can see our loved ones but we
43:03
can't hug I mean my mind my sister's
43:05
given birth to a baby go their first
43:07
baby my first niece during that I've yet
43:10
to meet him in person and holder I mean
43:12
this sort of lack of touch is really
43:13
hard so what are your thoughts on the
43:15
perhaps a longer term impact than our
43:16
health and mental health but also this
43:19
question of touch right well let me let
43:22
me touch just briefly because they did
43:24
some wonderful experiments where they
43:26
had people waiting for a painful medical
43:31
procedure or actually undergoing a
43:32
painful medical procedure and they
43:34
measured their heart rates when they
43:36
were alone having the procedure when
43:39
they were holding the hand of a complete
43:41
stranger or whether they were holding
43:43
the hand of a loved one and as you can
43:46
expect the heart rates of the people who
43:49
were alone were really high the heart
43:52
rates of the people who were holding the
43:54
hand of a complete stranger were lower
43:56
as they went through this difficult
43:58
experience and much lower still were the
44:00
heart rates of the people who could hold
44:02
the hand of a loved one so touch is key
44:05
going through hard times so that said
44:08
you know that question of what is the
44:11
effect on our mental health of this
44:13
pandemic it's gonna be really important
44:17
to know more about it and so what we're
44:19
realizing is as with physical
44:22
well we know that people unfortunately
44:24
are putting many of their mental health
44:26
needs on hold they're feeling like well
44:30
I can't I can't reach out to a therapist
44:32
or a doctor I can't do anything about it
44:35
actually that turns out not to be true
44:37
so the one thing I would say to you is
44:40
if you are feeling say very anxious or
44:44
depressed or suicidal uh that reach out
44:49
reach out for help that mental health is
44:53
one of the easiest things to get to get
44:56
online to get help with so I'm seeing my
45:00
patients online I will see two patients
45:02
this afternoon when this webinar is done
45:05
and we've been going right the way
45:07
through the pandemic and my colleagues
45:09
are doing new seeing new patients online
45:12
at the hospital where I work so please
45:15
don't don't feel like you have to hold
45:18
back from getting help let yourself get
45:20
help rather than waiting and waiting and
45:23
waiting until things get worse and then
45:27
what we want to do of course is to make
45:30
more and more help available as we
45:32
emerge from this pandemic because it is
45:35
making us all more stressed and more
45:37
agitated yes indeed thank you there's
45:42
some really helpful advice in there Bob
45:43
I'm gonna bring us to a question from
45:45
Christina now he says I work with older
45:47
people who often live on their own and
45:48
are currently very isolated I'm looking
45:51
to introduce them to mindfulness and
45:52
meditation do you have any advice on
45:54
ways to do this when we can't meet up
45:56
I'm trying to gauge whether physically
45:57
distance mindfulness walks might be a
45:59
way forward or essentially there's other
46:01
ways of doing that mindful activist in
46:03
distance way do you have any insights on
46:05
that I love that idea of physically
46:08
distanced mindfulness walks where you
46:11
help you know show people like mindfully
46:14
just let's just stop for a moment and
46:16
look at this tree you know and one of my
46:20
one of my teachers once said that a
46:23
great mindfulness exercise was what is
46:26
here that I haven't noticed before
46:29
so maybe I'm on a physically distanced
46:33
walk and I'm looking at
46:35
a tree that I go by every day but you
46:37
stop and you pay attention and you ask
46:39
everyone to notice what's here that I
46:41
haven't noticed before it's a great way
46:43
to introduce older people to mindfulness
46:46
the other thing is you could try
46:48
something like I did just now you know
46:51
online see if that helps for some people
46:55
it will help the other thing you could
46:58
do some of you may know that teaching by
47:02
tik not on the Vietnamese Zen teacher he
47:08
does an exercise where you mindfully eat
47:11
a raisin and you could probably look
47:14
this up I bet it's online and it's
47:16
certainly in someone is writing where
47:19
you could teach so anyone any like an
47:22
older adult could be sitting there and
47:24
you could ask him or her to take
47:28
something that they an ordinary thing
47:31
that they're used to eating but to
47:33
really mindfully eat it and you lead
47:35
them through the exercise of taking a
47:37
little bite and feeling what it feels
47:39
like in your mouth and all the different
47:41
tastes and you know you can imagine
47:42
going on and on but that's a way I think
47:46
especially for people who get scared of
47:49
being alone with their own minds which
47:52
we can get scared of especially if we're
47:54
not used to it
47:55
to try something like that mindful walk
47:58
where you spend three minutes looking at
48:02
a flower and nothing else or do that
48:05
mindful eating where you eat a raisin
48:08
mindfully do something like that with
48:10
older people and see if it resonates for
48:14
them thank you so jumping from older
48:18
people and that very interesting
48:19
question to young people so sue Ruffy
48:21
has asked what do you think the role of
48:23
education is in helping young people
48:25
learn the knowledge and skills and
48:27
attitudes they need for healthy
48:28
relationships you talked about how
48:30
important that is
48:31
obviously you know the home environment
48:33
and parenting plays a big role but what
48:34
about education how can we help young
48:36
people especially maybe in the world
48:38
where they're staring at screens so much
48:39
how can we yeah cultivate good
48:42
relationships for the next generation
48:43
thank you for asking that question that
48:46
is huge and and actually there's
48:49
there's this thing we talked about as
48:52
socio-emotional learning and you know we
48:56
talk about it a lot but but educators
48:59
have devoted a lot of time and energy to
49:01
developing really great programs to
49:05
teach children in schools at all ages
49:08
from pre-school ahna about feelings and
49:12
what feelings are like and how to be
49:13
with them and how to manage arguments
49:17
and disagreements and how to manage
49:19
feelings how to mane feelings and manage
49:21
them so there are these very very good
49:26
curricula that have been developed in
49:28
fact there's a there's a consortium
49:30
called castle CAS as in Sam e L
49:36
collaborative for academic and
49:39
socio-emotional learning you can go to
49:42
their website CA SEL and they will show
49:46
you all kinds of things that are going
49:47
on all over the world and you can see
49:51
all the curricula that have been
49:53
developed and what they find there's a
49:55
wonderful big analysis of hundreds of
49:59
studies that have shown that when they
50:00
give these programs to children in
50:02
schools they don't just do better
50:05
emotionally and in their relationships
50:07
they do better in math class they do
50:09
better at reading they get into trouble
50:12
less they get into fights less they get
50:15
kicked out of school less often so all
50:18
of that is to say that this kind of
50:20
learning is turning out to be wonderful
50:24
and what we have to do is help parents
50:27
who get worried that we're gonna try to
50:29
take over their children's minds we have
50:31
to help parents see that no no no this
50:33
is perfectly benign it's not religious
50:36
it's not anything it's just a way to
50:39
learn about how human beings operate and
50:43
how to handle all the thoughts and
50:45
feelings that come up in the best
50:47
possible ways thank you and I think in
50:52
on the subject of Education and this
50:54
current situation one of the things I've
50:56
observed having our children at home for
50:59
home learning first of all amazing a way
51:02
of helping all of us
51:02
realize how brilliant teachers are and
51:04
how hard yes yes to see the anxiety and
51:08
stress that conventional schooling was
51:09
causing my children but then in lockdown
51:11
a bit more freedom and creativity and
51:12
then going back to school now in recent
51:14
weeks where actually the pressure feels
51:15
a bit off everyone's a bit more
51:17
tentative the days are shorter it feels
51:19
like all the good bits of school being
51:21
together a bit of fun without quite as
51:23
much pressure and I can see my kids
51:25
flourishing in a way that they weren't
51:27
before so there's something about our
51:28
hot housing academic sort of system that
51:31
doesn't bring out those human values in
51:33
many of our young people I want to bring
51:36
this study for a second Bob because a
51:38
question that's come up a few times I
51:39
think is really important it's about
51:40
gender so obviously you mentioned that
51:42
this study because it was sort of a long
51:44
time ago was focused specifically on men
51:46
so maybe you want to say a little bit
51:47
about how you're trying to rebalance
51:49
that with the next generations if that's
51:50
the case but also carolina's asked a
51:52
reassuring question do you think if it
51:53
if it was more balanced as a study need
51:55
had more men in women as well as men in
51:58
there would you have found any different
51:59
results yes that is a great question
52:04
that is a great question and first of
52:06
all Oh
52:07
we are constantly apologizing for the
52:09
fact that our original sample was all
52:11
all white men I mean how it's so
52:14
politically incorrect and terrible to
52:16
assume that this is the way to study
52:18
adult life but that's what they started
52:21
with in 1938 so yes we have since we're
52:25
studying all their children when they
52:27
are 51% female as it turns out and so
52:31
thank goodness and of course the
52:35
grandchildren and the
52:36
great-grandchildren as well and I think
52:37
that question is really important would
52:39
we have found different things so
52:41
undoubtedly yes we would have found some
52:44
different things what we have been
52:46
impressed with studying the second
52:49
generation is that the similarities
52:52
between men and women are far greater
52:54
than the differences now that said there
52:58
are still important differences and so
53:01
one of the things that we do now is I'm
53:03
we're very careful to only talk about
53:06
findings that have been proven to be
53:09
true for women as well and when possible
53:13
when it's been studied proven to be true
53:16
other ethnic and cultural groups for
53:19
people of color because we know that
53:24
white males are not though you know that
53:28
what we find in a white male population
53:31
is not necessarily generalizable to the
53:36
whole world and so we're doing our best
53:38
to change that and to remedy that as we
53:41
go forward with the research so I look
53:43
forward to coming back together again in
53:44
about 75 years or we can get an update
53:51
hopefully and we've got time for a
53:55
couple more questions Bob I know you
53:56
know you're very generous in sparing all
53:57
this time for us and we promise to wrap
53:59
this up by 8 o'clock our time 3:00 p.m.
54:02
your time Lucy's got a great question
54:04
Robert she says as a psychiatrist how do
54:07
the findings of this study inform your
54:09
work they're only with people who have
54:10
mental ill-health
54:11
I know you've talked about it a little
54:13
bit already you want to say a bit more
54:14
on that yes yes it's it's such a good
54:19
question I think what I've found from
54:23
studying all these lives is that lives
54:26
take wonderfully unexpected turns that
54:30
sometimes they take negative turns yes
54:32
but that many times people surprise you
54:35
in the way their lives that seem doomed
54:38
to failure can turn out well and that
54:42
that surprising things can happen
54:45
including for people who struggle with
54:47
mental illness and so you know actually
54:51
my predecessor George valiant said
54:53
something I thought that was very
54:54
insightful he said what goes right in
54:57
human development is much more important
55:00
than what goes wrong now I'm not sure
55:02
that's totally true but what goes right
55:05
is very important and so people who are
55:08
even struggling with difficult health
55:11
problems and mental health problems can
55:14
with the right resources and the right
55:17
supports have good lives and do
55:20
wonderful things in the world which is
55:25
very good to hear thank you so we're
55:28
running out of time and I wanted to
55:29
bring a sort of full
55:30
circle back to what's really at the
55:32
heart of our mission was actually for
55:33
happiness which is not just about
55:34
dealing with our own mental well-being
55:37
and sort of supporting and nurturing
55:38
ourselves it's also this idea of
55:40
bringing that into the world and sort of
55:43
create a happier kind of way of living
55:45
sahar had a really interesting question
55:47
a bit early one saying how can we gain
55:49
the agency needed to effect change with
55:52
a bit more context it seems like there's
55:53
a lot of anger and frustration and not
55:55
being able to make much of a difference
55:56
so here we all are as individuals
55:58
there's all these big problems around us
56:00
things we'd like to put right how can we
56:02
gain that sense of efficacy agency
56:04
purpose to be able to see that we maybe
56:06
can have these ripple effects on the
56:08
world around us ah yes I've been asking
56:13
myself that a lot because there are some
56:14
things I really want to change right now
56:16
in the world and and I think what I've
56:19
been trying to do and and encourage
56:22
people I care about to do is to is to
56:26
think small when you start to feel
56:29
overwhelmed by the enormity of some of
56:32
these problems think small and think
56:35
about what you can do what you like to
56:38
do and what you're good at so you don't
56:41
have to do something else that you're
56:45
not good at but you feel like you're
56:46
supposed to do just start with what
56:48
you're good at maybe you're good at
56:50
calling people up so maybe you do a
56:53
phone tree about some organizing for
56:56
some cause maybe uh you lick envelopes
57:01
well maybe you I mean just anything that
57:04
you might do think about what you do and
57:07
then see how that that thing can be
57:09
brought into the world in the service of
57:13
the cause you care about in some way
57:15
because the danger is that we can feel
57:19
so overwhelmed that we're paralyzed
57:21
that's that's the big danger not that we
57:24
will do something too small but that we
57:26
won't do anything at all so tune in to
57:29
what you like what you care about what
57:31
you're good at and then just find a
57:34
place to do a little bit more of that in
57:36
the world what a lovely way to finish
57:39
Bob thank you for sharing that that's
57:41
certainly what so many of us in this
57:43
actual madness can
57:44
trying to do on our own small ways and
57:46
perhaps in some quite big ways together
57:48
as well I'm so grateful for you we're
57:51
all very grateful for you joining us and
57:53
I've been so grateful to see that the
57:55
thousands of people who join this call
57:56
have stayed during the call I can see
57:59
the numbers have stayed high throughout
58:00
so you've obviously kept people you
58:03
gauge thank you so much for being here
58:05
and I'm just to let you know and let the
58:07
participants know that we will be
58:08
sending a follow-up email run to
58:10
everybody tomorrow to share some of
58:11
those links that you mentioned to your
58:13
wonderful studies and work and also
58:16
before I hand back to you for maybe a
58:18
final thought before we close just to
58:20
let you know participants and people in
58:22
the actual happiness community our next
58:23

for happiness does and and everybody who
58:54
participates in it that this matters
58:56
like don't for a moment think this
58:58
doesn't matter this matters a lot and
59:01
that even though the problems are huge
59:03
what you are all doing is a big
59:06
contribution to what in my Zen life we
59:09
talked about as saving all beings that's
59:11
what you're about and I'm so grateful to
59:14
you all for doing it let's end there
59:18
