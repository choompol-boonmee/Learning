00:03
my own sense of frustration after a
00:07
career of some 43 years dealing with the
00:10
biophysical aspects of the
00:12
sustainability question as Professor de
00:16
booty mentioned I am a scientist I was
00:18
trained as a population and evolutionary
00:21
ecologist I have always had since my
00:24
early days on my grandparents farm a
00:27
profound interest in the connection
00:29
between Homo sapiens and the land or
00:32
ecosystems as it were and as she
00:35
indicated that inspired me throughout my
00:38
academic career to pursue dimensions of
00:41
human ecology which were not even
00:43
allowed in universities you could not
00:45
study when I was a student human beings
00:47
in an ecology Department precisely
00:50
because of the dualism that Professor
00:52
djibouti underscored I was directed to
00:55
go to economics or sociology or perhaps
00:58
anthropology but certainly not that to
01:01
look at humankind as a part of
01:03
ecosystems and to this day that kind of
01:06
attitude that construction of the human
01:08
mind in many respects and respect
01:11
supplies so I think it applies rather
01:14
and it is certainly part of the problem
01:17
that confronts us today what I want to
01:20
do then is to quickly run through how my
01:24
thinking has evolved as I try to unravel
01:28
the conundrum we seem to find ourselves
01:30
in basically it's this we claim to be
01:35
evidence of intelligent life on earth we
01:38
claim to be a knowledge-based society or
01:42
a science-based
01:43
culture and yet there's scarcely any
01:46
evidence of this at the level of
01:48
collective decision-making affecting the
01:50
most profound changes taking place on
01:53
the planet that ultimately affect our
01:55
own destiny so the question for me in
01:58
recent years has been how do we
02:00
reconcile the evidence of human
02:03
intelligence with the evidence that we
02:06
don't apply it and what lies behind the
02:09
command
02:10
that I'm going to play up for you this
02:13
evening some of you will undoubtedly
02:16
fall asleep in the course of this
02:18
discussion I think I've jumped them on
02:20
ahead I knew this was going to be
02:24
problematic so here is the summary of
02:32
what I have to say people are not
02:36
contrary to what we would like to think
02:38
of ourselves fundamentally rational high
02:41
intelligence does not play often a major
02:45
role particularly in collective
02:47
decision-making I have so little time I
02:50
could spend a whole hour distinguishing
02:52
between individual and collective
02:54
decision-making I can't do it this
02:57
evening I just want to make the
02:59
assertion then you can a take it or not
03:00
we don't act the same way in crowds as
03:03
we do as individuals
03:05
well if collective decision-making is
03:08
not dominated by intelligence what is it
03:11
dominated by and to a very large extent
03:13
I will make the argument that instinct
03:16
and emotion operating in short-term
03:18
self-interest is probably more important
03:22
in many instances than is data analysis
03:25
or intelligence in the kinds of actions
03:28
that take place at the political level
03:30
and by this I mean the defense for
03:33
example a political power the defense of
03:36
positions of wealth the defense of
03:38
social status all of these things will
03:41
take precedence over for example the
03:43
public interest in many of our public
03:46
policy debates it's possible to break
03:49
from this but not until we fully
03:52
understand the dynamics of what is in
03:54
fact going on behind the dilemmas
03:57
confronting us and finally I think we
04:00
have to appreciate that the alternative
04:03
is to maintain the status quo which we
04:05
are steadfastly doing and most of our
04:07
both global and national public policy
04:09
and should we do this I think there's a
04:11
high probability that we're going to see
04:13
significant resource scarcity
04:15
significant social strife and indeed
04:19
geopolitical conflict that could lead to
04:22
sea
04:23
more societal collapse is also a
04:26
possibility I don't think it's a remote
04:29
possibility it's becoming in fact
04:31
increasingly probable and as I will
04:34
illustrate to you the collapse of
04:37
societies is the norm for human cultures
04:40
that have reached this stage of their
04:42
evolution and continue to insist on the
04:45
current path without due attention to
04:48
the status quo so that's what I'm going
04:52
to attempt to do in the overview and now
04:55
I'm going to approach it in detail my
04:58
starting premise is one that a lot of
05:00
people choke on right away but I'd like
05:02
to be controversial to get those little
05:04
gray cells moving it is that humankind
05:07
particularly in our modern guise the
05:11
so-called modernist society techno
05:13
industrial society is fundamentally an
05:17
inherently unsustainable and the reason
05:20
for this is that we operate from
05:22
socially constructed models of human
05:25
behavior and of reality which do not map
05:28
well to the external biophysical reality
05:31
within which we find ourselves there is
05:34
no way I will assert in which we can
05:37
merely adjust our current economic
05:41
paradigm the development paradigm under
05:44
which the world is going forward so that
05:46
it can be compatible with the functions
05:48
and structure of biophysical systems
05:52
upon which we are all dependent so we
05:55
have a fundamental conflict then between
05:57
the way we think and act out in a world
06:00
which performs quite differently from
06:03
the assumptions built into our
06:04
understanding of that world I will
06:07
further assert and here's where some of
06:09
you will really stumble I think that
06:11
both genetic predispositions behavioral
06:14
predispositions that are rooted in our
06:16
genes and cultural memes are involved in
06:20
other words cultural ideas are in effect
06:25
reinforcing certain biological
06:27
predispositions leading to an untenable
06:29
circumstance which is leading us down
06:32
this unsustainable path we're in a
06:35
situation in which
06:37
these genetic tendencies I spoke of
06:39
which were once highly adaptive have
06:43
resulted in changes to the nature of the
06:46
biophysical domain such that those once
06:49
adaptive characteristics are now
06:51
maladaptive and are in danger then of
06:54
resulting in our being selected out in a
06:56
classical Darwinian sense so having made
07:02
that assertion I want to draw out two or
07:05
three of the elements about which I'm
07:08
speaking so that you have some grasp of
07:10
what I'm talking about here first of all
07:13
human beings are an evolved species we
07:16
don't pay much attention to this in fact
07:18
much of our political dogma or religious
07:21
dogma separates us out is if we are not
07:24
part of nature but just like every other
07:26
species on the planet we have evolved in
07:29
fact we've evolved extremely
07:30
successfully up until relatively
07:33
recently there are many qualities of
07:37
humans that have brought us to this
07:39
point but two of them I think are
07:41
particularly important in the in this
07:44
particular context and we share these
07:47
with all other species so I'm picking
07:49
two that we share with all of the
07:51
species but which we do so much better
07:53
than they do and the first of these is
07:56
that humankind has a tendency to occupy
08:00
all the accessible habitats available to
08:03
it
08:03
and if you think about it there are no
08:06
other species of advanced vertebrates on
08:08
the planet that have such a wide
08:10
geographic range as humans but the
08:12
possible exception of rats and mice
08:14
which tend to follow us around the
08:17
second point is that we have a tendency
08:19
to use in fact use up all available
08:23
resources now again this is a tendency
08:25
we share with all other species from
08:28
bacteria anyone who simply dropped a
08:30
bacterium on a petri dish and watched
08:32
for a few days to see the entire petri
08:35
dish colonized by that bacterium and all
08:37
the resources used up you should begin
08:40
to think of the planet as the human
08:42
petri dish we've covered it completely
08:44
with our own species and we are using up
08:47
all the available resources now
08:50
some people again will object this is
08:52
lots of resources left yes but we're in
08:54
the process of using them up in my own
08:57
country
08:58
we're digging oil from places that it
09:00
wouldn't even meant possible a few years
09:03
ago and putting them in to the world
09:05
marketplace just generally speaking if
09:08
we think again of energy we're getting
09:09
oil now from six kilometres below the
09:11
sea floor already four kilometres below
09:14
the surface of the ocean how many of you
09:16
want a credit card just out of curiosity
09:20
well you see how many of you actually
09:23
carry a balance from month to month on
09:25
your credit this video come on you can
09:28
admit you see income as a resource and
09:33
when we over expand our incomes we
09:36
devise other ways of consuming
09:38
continuing to consume resources by
09:40
simply making the month a plastic credit
09:42
card is a device by which you can
09:44
continue to consume after you've run out
09:46
of the primary resource which is your
09:48
income personal debt is now a major
09:52
driver of economic problems on this
09:54
country in Canada under the
09:57
reinforcement of advertising for example
09:59
in the last 30 years we've gone from
10:01
personal debt being something like 20
10:03
percent of household income to now
10:06
reaching a hundred and twenty percent of
10:08
household income so we have a situation
10:10
in which this predisposition to consume
10:13
all available resources is reinforced by
10:16
a cultural construction called credit
10:18
and is putting us further and further
10:20
into debt individually and globally main
10:25
point then is these are two very
10:26
important qualities that we share with
10:29
all of the species and to reinforce it I
10:31
do feel obliged to give you a couple of
10:33
examples this is the decline of the
10:37
breeding stock of North Atlantic cod
10:39
long after it was in a sense brought
10:43
under the domain of a single nation the
10:45
idea being the ownership of a resource
10:47
will result in its conservation nothing
10:50
could be further from the truth in these
10:52
circumstances for several hundred years
10:55
if not thousands of years the cod
10:57
supported human beings at a certain
11:00
sustained level or sustainable level
11:03
of exploitation but with modern
11:05
technology and if you were watching
11:07
carefully in my last slide I said not
11:09
only do humans have a tendency to use
11:11
all available resources but in the case
11:14
of humans availability is defined by the
11:16
current levels of technology and so as
11:18
technology advanced in the post-war
11:20
period in the world's fisheries one by
11:23
one we've knocked off major stocks of
11:26
fish I think further evidence to my own
11:28
idea that we will use up all the
11:31
available resources the cod stocks
11:33
collapse in their collapsed in 1992 all
11:36
fishing was suspended that was some 20
11:39
odd years ago and as yet their stocks
11:42
had not recovered this was a very
11:46
interesting study which attempted to
11:48
identify about a hundred other species
11:51
they 96 species of mammals with
11:54
relatively similar ecological qualities
11:57
to humans in other words octopi similar
12:00
niches within their domains as humankind
12:02
and the hypothesis that these scientists
12:08
attempted to test here was that humans
12:11
are not a normal species and indeed they
12:14
found evidence in support of that this
12:17
is simply one of many graphs they
12:19
produced this happens to be a plot a log
12:23
normal plot of the appropriation of
12:26
biomass in other words the feeding
12:28
tendencies of these various species how
12:30
much biomass did these 96 or 97 species
12:34
appropriate from their ecosystems and
12:36
humans are the little black box out on
12:39
the far right a clear outlier species we
12:43
appropriate more biomass from ecosystems
12:46
that we happen to exploit by two orders
12:49
of magnitude than those species at the
12:52
upper 95% confidence limit of this
12:55
distribution of about a 95 or 96 other
12:58
species so once again human technology
13:01
has made us superb at appropriating
13:03
resources from ecosystems that sustain
13:06
us so those are simply bits of evidence
13:10
of my assertion that we are propelled
13:15
unconsciously
13:17
by biological predispositions to occupy
13:20
all available space and to use up all
13:22
available resources and we do this
13:25
better than any other species and
13:27
therefore have some claim to being
13:29
frankly the most vicious predator and
13:32
herbivorous organism that ever walked if
13:34
I occupied the face of this earth has
13:36
ever walked on the planet far out doing
13:39
the most voracious of the dinosaurs now
13:43
I mentioned that there is a
13:44
reinforcement of the biological producer
13:47
predispositions that comes strictly from
13:50
culture and here are just two quotes I
13:53
have volumes of these sorts of things
13:55
from various colleagues and economists
13:58
and technological optimists of one kind
14:01
or another
14:02
humans are inherently optimistic so
14:05
there's a biological component of this
14:07
as well but it's become embedded in some
14:10
of our most powerful disciplines the
14:12
first of these quotes is by Lawrence
14:14
Summers who at the time he said this
14:16
particular statement was the chief
14:19
economist of the World Bank he then went
14:22
on to a number of roles but to be the
14:25
president of Harvard University until
14:28
President Barack Obama in the United
14:30
States was elected whereupon he became
14:32
the chair of the President's Council of
14:36
Economic Advisers in other words the top
14:38
economists in the United States but this
14:40
expresses his belief to this day there
14:43
are no limits to the carrying capacity
14:44
of the earth that are likely to bind at
14:47
any time in the foreseeable future
14:50
probably the most a billion tacca
14:52
demmick proponent of the view of no
14:54
limits is the late Julian Simon who is a
14:57
professor of management science at
14:59
Maryland University we have in our hands
15:02
now the technology to feed clothe and
15:05
supply energy to an ever-growing human
15:07
population for the next 7 billion years
15:11
this is not a modest statement as a
15:15
matter of fact he was challenged on this
15:17
statement and immediately backed down
15:19
and said there
15:20
had been a misprint it was meant to say
15:22
seven million years no that's an
15:25
enormous backing down three orders of
15:28
magnitude by an economist a physicist
15:32
friend of mine at the University of
15:33
Colorado took Simon up on his correction
15:37
and very generously said let's assume a
15:40
1% per annum growth rate which by the
15:44
way is very generous because at the time
15:46
it was one point a 4% let us also assume
15:50
a starting population of about 5.6
15:52
billion which is where it was when Simon
15:54
made this statement the question then
15:57
becomes how many people would there be
15:59
on earth if the human population grew by
16:02
just 1% per year for a mere 7 million
16:06
years have any of you a pocket
16:09
calculator well it wouldn't do any good
16:12
if you did because you couldn't possibly
16:14
do this calculation it's a very simple
16:18
one but the number of iterations is
16:20
beyond the capacity of your pocket
16:23
calculator the answer I can't remember
16:25
exactly but it's something like 2 point
16:28
4 7 raised to the 30 thousand four
16:30
hundred and fiftieth power which is
16:33
about 30,000 orders of magnitude greater
16:37
than the number of atoms in the known
16:39
universe now that's a significant number
16:43
and I merely use it to to underscore the
16:47
degree to which are socially constructed
16:49
the boolean and self confidence is so
16:53
utterly ridiculous when put to the test
16:55
of a simple little arithmetic check and
16:58
yet this kind of statement is throughout
17:02
the language or the dialogue where we
17:05
talk about the unlimited nature of human
17:07
capacity so what aren't you drawn for
17:11
you so far is a species that has unusual
17:15
intellectual capacity and ability to
17:17
manipulate nature it is a species driven
17:20
by subtle predispositions tendencies
17:25
toward the occupation of space for the
17:28
consumption of resources reinforced by
17:31
its own cultural mythology
17:33
we have a cultural narrative of
17:35
unlimited growth which propels and
17:38
compounds the effect of our biological
17:40
predispositions now for the vast
17:43
majority of human history
17:46
it didn't matter our technological
17:48
competence was so limited that having
17:51
this predisposition to expand the
17:53
predisposition to use up resources was
17:57
of no real consequence we Renault really
17:59
not much different from other species
18:01
our populations merely fluctuated in any
18:04
particular place and the only growth of
18:06
human populations for most of say of a
18:09
50 thousand years since the emergence of
18:11
modern humans in Europe for example has
18:13
been the expansion of people over the
18:16
surface of the earth so this curve
18:18
simply represents two thousand years of
18:21
recent human history RIT in terms of
18:25
population
18:25
I could have extended this axis to the
18:29
left another couple of hundred thousand
18:31
years which would have made stark the
18:34
obvious point that the recent history of
18:37
200 years in that two hundred thousand
18:39
years is an anomaly only eight
18:42
generations of humans have experienced
18:46
significant growth significant enough to
18:48
be noticed in their lifetimes
18:51
for example so if you went back 500
18:54
years right here a person might be born
18:56
I must say they were lucky to live 90
18:58
years
19:00
perhaps it was during a time of plague
19:02
when local population collapsed by 30%
19:05
certainly no technological change would
19:08
have occurred their cultural tools used
19:10
at the time of birth would have been
19:12
essentially the same as those that were
19:15
in play at the time of that individual's
19:17
death nothing much happened so what I
19:21
want to underscore here is that we
19:23
really live in a truly unique period
19:25
eight generations of people have
19:27
experienced sufficient growth to notice
19:30
it but all of us in this room are part
19:32
of that period so we take and have
19:35
incorporated into our cultural narrative
19:37
the idea that the norm is growth and
19:40
indeed every government on the planet is
19:43
struggling to maintain two three four in
19:46
a case of
19:46
chyna they need eight or nine percent
19:48
population growth simply to keep things
19:51
rolling and to avoid social insurrection
19:54
because of the great disparity of
19:56
benefits and costs within that country
19:59
only at two or three hundred million
20:01
people have actually gained much from
20:03
the great boom in China there's another
20:05
billion who are still waiting to jump
20:06
upon the bandwagon so we have a very
20:10
unusable situation in which we conceived
20:14
of our own period as the norm when in
20:17
fact it's probably the single most a
20:18
monopolist period in the history of our
20:21
species and I put a little arrow loops
20:24
there are to show that we can account
20:27
for this explosion of the human
20:29
enterprise largely by our technological
20:33
capacity to begin using fossil fuels in
20:35
large quantities now of course some will
20:38
say what was Medical Science enabled all
20:40
of these people to live true enough but
20:42
it wouldn't have made any difference had
20:44
we not been able to acquire the
20:46
resources and the food to sustain that
20:49
growth and the resources and the food
20:52
are largely the product of fossil energy
20:54
ninety percent of our food production
20:56
today bit well between 75 and 90 percent
20:59
is really attributable to fossil fuel
21:02
rather than any a natural contribution
21:05
so we could go on at length about this
21:08
my main point is then that there's a
21:11
huge coincidence between our use of
21:13
fossil fuel and the explosion of the
21:15
human enterprise now notice this is
21:18
simply a graph showing the increase in
21:21
fossil fuel use it starts expanding
21:24
around 1850 which is exactly the point
21:27
at which I have my little arrow going
21:29
here and so you can see again the
21:31
parallelism between the explosion in the
21:34
human enterprise and our use of fossil
21:37
fuels this is going forward under
21:40
exponential growth this is a pattern of
21:43
growth inputs as a fixed doubling time
21:45
and I think it's important to recognize
21:47
that in just the last 30 years or so
21:51
one-half of all the fossil fuel ever
21:54
used has been consumed if the world
21:57
economy doubles again which it will do
21:59
about twenty three years that's a three
22:02
percent growth than the use of fossil
22:04
fuel in the next twenty three years
22:06
assuming as every International Energy
22:09
Agency report claims also fuel will
22:11
still be 80 percent of the basis of the
22:13
economy twenty or thirty years from now
22:16
if that doubling occurs then we will use
22:19
as much coal as has ever been used in
22:21
all of history prior okay so the next
22:26
doubling means we will double everything
22:27
that you see on the board in terms of
22:29
fossil field I'll put that in the
22:31
context of climate change for example
22:34
okay and that gives me a good segue into
22:38
this slide one of the consequences of
22:41
the use of fossil fuel is a consequence
22:43
of a simple physical law called the law
22:46
of mass balance everything that goes
22:49
into the economy as a resource comes out
22:51
as waste everything even this building
22:54
someday will be discarded as waste one
22:58
of the most immediate returns to the
23:00
ecosphere of the use of fossil fuel is
23:03
the carbon in that fuel it emerges in
23:05
the form of carbon dioxide and what this
23:08
graph shows and again I don't know if
23:11
any of you are climate skeptics this is
23:13
not a model
23:14
these are measurement data of the
23:16
concentration of carbon dioxide in the
23:19
atmosphere over a period of about 70 odd
23:22
years and what we see is a steady
23:26
accelerating increase in that mysterion
23:29
traces of carbon dioxide we've pushed
23:32
those concentrations up by about 40
23:34
percent since the pre-industrial period
23:36
from about 288 parts per million up to
23:40
about 390 parts per million in August of
23:43
last year this is an accelerating rate
23:47
of increase so it's actually super
23:48
exponential the rate of increase is
23:51
virtually doubled in the last 30 to 40
23:54
years and so this becomes a significant
23:57
problem to keep in mind these as I say
24:00
our measurement data they're not the
24:01
product of a model they're taken on a
24:04
volcano at the top of mana law in Hawaii
24:07
thousands of kilometres from any
24:10
industrial activity and yet the
24:12
instrumental measurements are
24:13
sensitive enough to capture what some
24:16
people refer to as the breathing of the
24:18
earth the optics represent the winter
24:23
periods during which vegetation in the
24:25
northern hemisphere is shut down and
24:28
photosynthesis is not taking place we're
24:31
burning lots of fossil fuel in our
24:33
transportation to heat our buildings and
24:35
so on and so forth so there's a rapid
24:37
accumulation in the atmosphere in the
24:40
spring as northern hemisphere vegetation
24:42
wakes up and begins to photosynthesize
24:45
and convert that carbon back into
24:48
biomass in the form of wood then there's
24:50
a rapid decline in the amount of carbon
24:53
dioxide in the atmosphere those are the
24:55
down kicks but every year the uptick
24:58
becomes a little longer than the down
25:00
tick so the overall trend is an
25:02
accelerating trend upwards and therefore
25:05
a continuing problem this is the
25:11
temperature correlate and again it's
25:12
it's not the output of a model per se
25:14
these are measurement data now climate
25:18
skeptics may pick a piece of this graph
25:20
and say from 1940 to 1980 Oh warming
25:24
it's all mythic but this is a period
25:27
during which the oceans were
25:28
assimilating much of the heat for
25:30
example and so it was less available to
25:32
accumulate in the atmosphere when ocean
25:34
surface temperatures rise then there's
25:37
less of a temperature differential
25:38
between oceans and atmosphere and more
25:41
accumulation occurs in the atmosphere
25:42
that's what we get a steady steep
25:44
increase in any case the overall trend
25:48
is clearly an upward trend that
25:50
correlates very strongly with the
25:52
increase in carbon dioxide it's only one
25:55
of the greenhouse gases but it's the one
25:57
that is changing and so there's a very
25:59
high probability of a relationship
26:01
between the increase in carbon dioxide
26:04
and the increase in the global
26:06
temperature which has risen about 0.8
26:09
degrees in the past hundred years or so
26:15
and the heat goes on 2005 was the
26:21
hottest year in the instrumental record
26:23
well tied with 2008 and 2011 my brother
26:28
saw 2010 and 2005 and 2008 or more or
26:32
less tied in this position we are
26:36
currently with all the policies that
26:37
have been put in place by governments
26:39
everywhere we are on track to achieve
26:42
about a four Celsius degree increase in
26:44
mean global temperature in the next
26:47
month for the duration of this century a
26:49
mean global temperature increase of
26:52
point of 4 degrees Celsius would desert
26:55
a fine most of China much of India much
26:57
of the southern United States northern
26:59
South America Africa and so on
27:01
displacing literally hundreds of
27:03
millions if not billions of people a
27:04
forcing them to be can become climate
27:07
refugees so this that's where we are
27:10
right now I'm not saying this will
27:11
happen I'm simply saying with all the
27:14
discussion we've had in all the climate
27:16
conferences around the world and all the
27:19
policies that have been agreed to and
27:20
put in place and I'm not saying there's
27:22
a lot of them but as far as we've gone
27:24
that's the track that we are on today ok
27:28
and I want to underscore I've spent some
27:30
time with climate here because it's
27:32
something most of us do with it's simply
27:34
one example of dozens of manifestations
27:37
of what I've come to now call
27:39
fundamental human ecological dysfunction
27:41
for the various reasons that I've been
27:43
talking about professor Daboo Dean
27:47
mentioned this method that I developed
27:50
with my students for some several
27:52
decades now called ecological footprint
27:55
analysis what we do is measure the area
27:59
of the surface of the earth or more
28:01
precisely the area of productive
28:03
ecosystems on land and water needed to
28:06
sustain any given population in its
28:09
current pattern of consumption so if I
28:13
could have a summary of Newcastle's
28:17
annual shopping basket we could plug it
28:20
into our data grinder and tell you what
28:23
Newcastle's ecological footprint is how
28:25
much have you ever asked this question
28:28
we'll grab somebody you have how many of
28:29
you lain awake at night staring at the
28:31
ceiling and asked yourself just how much
28:34
of the Earth's surface is dedicated to
28:36
supporting just me in the style to which
28:38
I am accustomed good that's the first
28:45
question of human ecology we should all
28:47
be fascinated by that question because
28:49
the simple fact of the matter is it's a
28:51
calculable number and we are all in
28:54
competition for the available bio
28:57
capacity on this planet if you're a
28:59
typical Brit you need about 5 global
29:04
average hectares as a North American I
29:06
lay claim to about 8 so every one of us
29:10
has an ecological footprint represented
29:13
by the surface area required to produce
29:15
the resources we consume and to
29:17
assimilate critical waste
29:19
particularly the carbon dioxide now what
29:22
this graph shows is that sometime in the
29:24
last few decades we passed the point
29:26
what we referred to as one planet living
29:29
living the point at which the current
29:32
level of consumption by the present
29:34
human population could be sustained
29:37
indefinitely by the bio capacity of
29:39
planet Earth but for a couple of decades
29:43
now we have been living in a state of
29:45
overshoot overshoot implies that we are
29:50
consuming more than the earth can
29:52
produce or in other words we're
29:54
dissipating natural capital faster than
29:56
the earth can regenerate it and we are
29:59
filling waste sinks to overflowing
30:01
we are ejecting more garbage into the
30:04
ecosphere than ecosystems can assimilate
30:06
and reprocess back into for example
30:09
biomass so a state of imbalance exists
30:12
between consumption of resources and
30:15
discharge of wastes by the human
30:18
enterprise and the capacity of the
30:20
entire global system to produce
30:23
resources and to assimilate the
30:25
byproducts of our industrial and
30:28
consumptive activities now again some
30:31
people will stumble on this but just
30:32
think of those fisheries think of the
30:34
excess erosion of soils think of the
30:37
water tables that are in decline think
30:39
of the accumulation of
30:40
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere most of
30:43
us aren't accustomed to thinking of
30:45
carbon dioxide as waste but by weight
30:48
carbon dioxide is the single greatest
30:51
waste product produced by every
30:53
industrial culture as I said what goes
30:57
in in the form of fossil fuel and it's
30:59
the input to our industrial culture
31:02
which my weight is the largest of all
31:04
will inevitably produce an equivalent
31:06
amount of waste which happens to be the
31:09
largest by weight of all wastes
31:11
generated by our industrial culture so
31:14
we simply can't get around the
31:16
biophysical reality in which we find
31:18
ourselves in trained and we are
31:20
currently living at about 30 to 50
31:24
percent above the long term carrying
31:26
capacity of the planet we are sustaining
31:28
ourselves now when I say we I mean the
31:30
global human enterprise by depleting our
31:33
capital assets just as you can borrow
31:37
money with a credit card and over
31:39
consume at some point you will come up
31:42
NSF and will have to repay your debt and
31:45
we will have to repay our debt for
31:48
nature okay so what I've tried to do
31:52
thus far just do tap just to say look
31:55
we're a unique species we're incredibly
31:58
adapted incredibly intelligent at
32:01
manipulating the natural world but we're
32:04
driven by subtle forces we don't fully
32:06
understand
32:07
including a predisposition to expand to
32:10
fill all available habitat and use all
32:12
available resources we've created a
32:16
social narrative a cultural narrative
32:18
based on infinite growth which
32:19
reinforces those tendencies and blinds
32:22
us to many of the realities that are
32:25
inevitable when you have a single entity
32:28
on a finite planet growing indefinitely
32:31
you cannot how many of you really think
32:33
that infinite material growth is
32:35
possible on a finite planet raise your
32:38
hands please
32:39
alright so no one admits to it and yet
32:42
we live our lives every day we subscribe
32:45
to economies and bank accounts and
32:47
pension funds every day that are based
32:50
precisely on that assumption so we're
32:52
all victims in a sense of a car
32:54
dissonance our intelligence tells us one
32:57
thing and yet as I said at the outset we
32:59
go about creating social institutions
33:01
which are diametrically opposed in their
33:04
beliefs values and assumptions to the
33:06
biophysical reality we all claim we
33:08
believe in from the perspective of sheer
33:11
intelligent analysis okay so we have a
33:14
problem
33:15
we're overusing the planet it's
33:17
beginning to feed back I suggested that
33:20
we were very successful in our use of
33:23
resources and certainly more successful
33:25
than any other species in occupying the
33:28
earth and I said that these were the
33:30
result of adaptive tendencies but those
33:33
tendencies have now because of the sheer
33:35
scale of the human enterprise begun to
33:38
change the very environment in which
33:40
they were adaptive so we now have a
33:43
situation in which we are being
33:45
propelled forward by tendencies which
33:47
are maladaptive precisely because of
33:50
this success success of those very
33:52
tendencies well we have also unique ways
33:56
of getting editors if we choose to use
33:59
them and I've already
34:01
underscored one of these no other
34:04
species can match humans at least in
34:07
theory in terms of our capacity for
34:09
evidence based reasoning and logical
34:12
analysis that's a uniquely human quality
34:15
no other species comes close the human
34:20
beings in their capacity for forward
34:22
planning
34:23
I've taught 40 years in a planning
34:25
school I've been invited to be here by a
34:28
planning school so apparently we have
34:30
this profound belief in our capacity to
34:33
use our high intelligence our logical
34:36
analysis to plan our own future to
34:39
manipulate data to change the future for
34:42
the better no other species can make
34:44
that claim these other two qualities are
34:47
also important but not exclusive to
34:50
humans humans can make moral judgments
34:53
to a much greater degree than any other
34:56
species we have the choice of
34:58
determining what is right or wrong and
35:00
by the way to some degree that's a
35:02
social construct - but that's an ability
35:04
that we express to a greater degree than
35:06
any other species
35:07
finally we have the ability to exercise
35:11
compassion we can feel sorry for other
35:14
people or other species now again there
35:17
are probably a dozen or 15 additional
35:20
qualities that are important but I think
35:22
these are the most significant ones in
35:25
the context we are talking about have we
35:28
any evidence on the global scale that in
35:33
resolving the kinds of problems I've
35:35
tried to underscore for you if ever
35:37
briefly that we are applying on the
35:39
collective basis our capacity for
35:42
evidence based reasoning our capacity
35:45
for forward planning our capacity to
35:47
exercise moral judgment in our treatment
35:49
of other human beings and our capacity
35:52
fruits to extend compassion to other
35:55
people or other species okay so we have
36:02
this inordinate capacity for forward
36:06
planning and thinking I love this little
36:09
quote abut it many years ago and it kept
36:10
it with me ever since
36:13
importantly heidegger's discourse I'm
36:16
thinking this pops out he says today
36:19
mankind is in flight I'm thinking he was
36:22
actually referring here to our rather to
36:26
rapid adoption of certain technologies
36:28
without a rationale or without a
36:30
detailed assessment of what the likely
36:32
consequences would be so he wasn't
36:34
referring to the simple-minded
36:36
utilitarian kind of thinking that you go
36:38
about when choosing a new automobile or
36:40
whatever he was talking about the deep
36:42
philosophical issues around you know our
36:45
destiny and how we go about shaping the
36:49
planet which we lived I think this is
36:51
exactly the point I'm trying to make you
36:55
despite decades of hardening evidence
36:58
and rising rhetoric what politician
37:00
hasn't spoken eloquently and at length
37:02
but the need for a paradigm shift to
37:05
more sustainable lifestyles despite all
37:08
of that no national government no
37:10
prominent international agency no major
37:13
corporate individual has begun to
37:16
advocate in public let alone implement
37:19
the kinds of policy changes
37:21
that are really called forth by the kind
37:26
of data that we have at our disposal
37:27
today how do we explain this remember
37:32
well this is where the biology and
37:35
sociology interface once again Pedro sis
37:39
double sanski in a famous essay and
37:42
later a book made this statement nothing
37:45
in biology makes sense except in light
37:48
of evolution I'm sure most of you are
37:50
aware that Darwin's he didn't give us a
37:53
theory of evolution he gave us the
37:55
mechanism by which it takes place the
37:57
theory of natural selection and that's
38:00
really what doves ants key is talking
38:01
about here that nothing in biology makes
38:04
sense unless you interpret through the
38:06
Darwinian lens of natural selection and
38:09
what I want to do for the rest of this
38:11
talk is to make the point once again
38:13
that humans are an evolved species and
38:17
that human affairs have evolved along
38:20
with us the kinds of discourses we
38:23
conduct among ourselves as species are
38:26
as much part of our biological as they
38:28
are part of our cultural heritage it
38:30
therefore follows I will submit that
38:32
nothing in human affairs including our
38:35
economic and social behavior makes much
38:37
sense except in light of evolution and
38:41
again I want to underscore another
38:44
unique quality of humans that our own
38:46
evolution today is as much controlled if
38:49
not more controlled by cultural factors
38:52
mimetic entities as they are by genetic
38:55
factors of the genetic but both are in
38:58
play here we can discuss this later at
39:01
that point and if we accept that that
39:04
there are these subtle forces that come
39:07
from our biological predispositions as
39:11
well as our cultural predispositions
39:13
they are emitting not mitigated exactly
39:17
but integrated through a remarkable
39:19
instrument called the human brain now
39:22
again here we have to distinguish the
39:23
similarities and the differences between
39:26
the human brain and the brain of other
39:28
organisms this is a very simple model
39:31
it's called the triune brain
39:34
I presented to you precisely because it
39:36
is simple there are much more
39:38
complicated interpretations of this but
39:40
they don't really make much difference
39:43
from the kind of interpretation I'm
39:44
going to give you every one of you
39:47
carries a brain that looks more or less
39:50
like this it has evolved in three major
39:54
leaps as it were we all have something
39:57
called the reptilian brain stem the
40:00
reptilian complex of old brain this is
40:03
the seat of many instincts that pertain
40:08
to survival it's the point in which the
40:11
flight-or-fight response is initiated it
40:16
is the point in which we have many of
40:19
our hardwired instincts our autonomic
40:22
response you don't have to think about
40:23
breathing and if I go like that you see
40:25
if you could have seen professor
40:27
Djibouti she blinked her eyes she didn't
40:29
think oh there's a fist coming at me I'd
40:30
better blink my eyes it just happens
40:32
like that and that was her reptilian
40:34
brain stem defending her against the
40:37
threat from the outside any thing we all
40:40
do that later on they revolve the
40:44
midbrain this is the old mammalian brain
40:47
sometimes referred to again this
40:49
overlaps and controversy around the
40:52
details here but the limbic system this
40:55
is a seed of emotion this is the seed of
40:58
some kinds of our memories feelings
41:00
responses to food sex and so on and so
41:03
forth our gain we share this with many
41:05
other mammals some bird species and so
41:07
on but unique to humans is the third
41:11
component here not unique in the sense
41:13
that other species don't have it but
41:15
it's uniquely well developed in
41:17
humankind the cerebrum or the neocortex
41:20
the new brain is the seat of our
41:23
intelligence our capacity for logic our
41:27
capacity for forward planning the
41:29
exercise of our linguistic abilities
41:31
upon which all of the rest of this
41:33
hinges so we all carry all of this
41:37
around with us and the Machine operates
41:40
as you can call it a machine but it's an
41:42
integrated whole but the problem is we
41:45
often do not know which of the
41:47
three components is in control you know
41:51
that emotions can elicit thinking we
41:55
also know that sometimes our thinking
41:57
penny licit emotions which may also
41:59
force us to do things we regret later so
42:03
there's always this interplay between
42:05
the various components of the brain the
42:08
problem is that we live in consciousness
42:10
we live in the cerebral bit everything
42:12
else happens beneath consciousness so we
42:15
tend to give excessive credence to the
42:17
notion that we have free will that we're
42:20
resident up here and that everything we
42:23
do is a matter of choice I choose to do
42:25
certain how many of you have ever been
42:27
at a all-you-can-eat buffet how many of
42:33
you have ever said I will have one plate
42:35
of food I will take it to my table I
42:37
will not return to that buffet few more
42:42
hands how many you've ever succeeded how
42:44
many of you have ever succeeded in
42:46
sticking to your resolution no hands at
42:49
all because you see we tend to consume
42:53
all available resources you have evolved
42:56
to be attracted to sweets
42:58
salts and fats and within there in
43:01
incredible abundance most of us have to
43:04
exercise exceptional will not to go back
43:07
to have that one last peanut as I leave
43:10
the room so we're are trapped and I
43:14
think you can think of many other
43:15
instances where you have been compelled
43:18
by instinct or desire or emotion to do
43:20
something against your better judgment
43:22
and what I'm trying to submit to you is
43:25
that most of our actions in life are
43:26
like that they're combination of the
43:29
emotion instinct of judgment and it may
43:32
not be the case that the higher
43:36
intelligence is in control at all times
43:39
or even at any time so again to go back
43:43
to the beginning we claim to be a
43:44
uniquely self conscious and rational
43:46
species we live in that cerebral
43:49
awareness of our own existence some say
43:52
that's the Equality however
43:54
circumstances in which reason
43:56
predominates are limited to relatively
43:59
trivial circumstances
44:00
here made circumstances in which pure
44:03
reason dominates our limited to
44:06
relatively trivial situations passion
44:09
and instinct often trump reason when
44:13
push comes to shellfish of here's a
44:15
marvelous editorial cartoon please don't
44:18
anyone tell anyone I'm using it but here
44:20
it is again look at the tension between
44:24
the socially constructed and the
44:27
intellectually known the end of the
44:32
world scenario will be rife with
44:33
unimaginable horrors however we believe
44:36
that the pre end period will be filled
44:39
with unprecedented opportunities for
44:41
profit and I think that's a brilliant
44:45
statement of precisely the dilemma I'm
44:48
putting to you our intelligence tells us
44:50
what's going on out there our own best
44:53
scientific analyses say we're in dire
44:56
straits and yet in my own country the
44:59
entire economic development policy is
45:02
now based on the export of fossil fuel
45:05
developing the oil sands and so on
45:08
you're having a huge debate here of
45:10
whether you should go fracking for gas
45:12
and oil and so on and so forth they see
45:14
that has to be taking place in a
45:17
compartment of the brain that is
45:18
completely ignorant of the consequences
45:22
of proceeding along those lines it's a
45:24
discussion I'm having some of my MPs and
45:36
now this isn't news as I've studied more
45:42
and more about this dilemma I've come
45:44
across more and more that tells me we've
45:46
known about this all along
45:48
miron Dolan was a Venetian rather
45:53
forensic Florence a Renaissance Italian
45:55
priest philosopher and he put it this
45:59
way man was created by nature in such a
46:01
way that reason might dominate the
46:04
senses but there's this tension again
46:06
between emotion and instinct and the
46:09
capacity the unique capacity god-given
46:11
in marin dollars turn
46:13
for reasoning and that by its law the
46:17
law of reason all rage and desire of
46:19
passion and lust must be restrained but
46:23
when the image of God has been forgotten
46:24
we begin to serve the beasts within us
46:28
what a clear statement of the of the
46:32
kind of understanding of the tension
46:34
that exists in every one of us between
46:37
the baser emotions and motives and what
46:41
our intellect tells us Antonio Damasio
46:44
is one of the best known of modern
46:47
neuroscientists and he says the same
46:50
thing using much more technical
46:52
up-to-date language that's the same
46:54
point there are indeed potions in our
46:56
bodies and brains the brain by the way
46:58
is not only part of the nervous system
47:00
as part of the endocrine system it
47:03
exudes chemicals that make us feel good
47:06
or bad and induce us to do things that
47:09
we would not otherwise do we know this
47:12
there are indeed potions in their bodies
47:14
and brains capable of forcing on us
47:16
behaviors that we may or may not be able
47:20
to suppress by strong resolution now
47:23
again just refer to your own life
47:25
experience for two seconds you satisfied
47:30
that this is a real of course you are so
47:37
Homo sapiens is genetically predisposed
47:39
to abandon reason for comfortable
47:42
cultural myths and social narratives
47:45
just as you are genetically predisposed
47:48
to maintain very comfortable lifestyle
47:52
and the game we've known about this for
47:56
some very long period of time the first
47:59
of these quotes is from a book you can
48:01
download from the Internet in its
48:02
entirety it's called the crowd a study
48:05
of the popular mind by an early
48:07
behavioral psychologists to stab to the
48:10
bone in France the masses have never
48:13
thirsted after truth they turn aside
48:16
from evidence that is not to their taste
48:18
preferring to deify error
48:22
a more modern statement of the same
48:25
principle by derekjjensen the popular
48:27
American I suppose cultural philosopher
48:30
for us to maintain our way of living we
48:33
must tell lies to each other and
48:35
especially to ourselves the lies are
48:39
necessary because without them certain
48:43
acts would become impossibilities so we
48:49
have a built-in means of deluding
48:52
ourselves into doing certain things
48:56
because if we didn't delude ourselves
48:58
into doing those and couldn't possibly
49:00
do them we would have to pay attention
49:02
to the data and our conscious analyses
49:05
of those data think of this in terms of
49:11
socio-political behavior we have
49:14
constructed I would argue a society in
49:21
which one's position is based on the
49:25
possession of large automobiles large
49:28
houses the size of one's paycheck and so
49:31
on and so forth because our self-esteem
49:35
our status our political power depends
49:38
on those things we will defend them
49:42
against all evidence but to do so in the
49:46
long run may be fatal to our own
49:48
interests certainly to the interests of
49:50
the community at large so we are in a
49:55
situation I would argue in which these
49:58
kinds of social defense mechanisms
50:02
operate beneath consciousness and defeat
50:06
public policy for example and again this
50:10
should not be a surprise Machiavelli if
50:14
you read a little Machiavelli you will
50:17
recognize was a master of understanding
50:19
and precisely this principle look at
50:22
this next quote it says exactly the same
50:23
as the previous one the way men live is
50:26
so far removed from the way they ought
50:28
to live now the way they opted with live
50:30
of course is the weight reason and good
50:33
governance and so on says we ought to
50:35
live in
50:36
society as civilized beings the way men
50:41
actually led the soul far removed from
50:43
that that anyone who abandons what is
50:46
the way we actually behave not the way
50:49
we should behave for what should be
50:52
pursues his downfall rather than his
50:55
preservation so in other words if you
50:57
don't act out of these primitive once
51:00
adaptive instincts you're likely to be
51:02
erased from the political stage and
51:05
hence we have this powerful
51:07
predisposition to defend the
51:09
indefensible in the face of the evidence
51:12
that to do so is against our individual
51:15
and certainly our collective long-term
51:17
interests now again if we want further
51:22
evidence of this I would refer you to
51:24
Barbara to friends Pulitzer
51:27
prize-winning American historian and her
51:30
book the march of folly in it she quotes
51:33
comes at the logs and Stan of Sweden who
51:37
on his deathbed is purported to have
51:38
said to a son know my son with how
51:41
little wisdom the world is governed sums
51:44
if there's no wisdom out there just so
51:46
we don't use it in governing ourselves
51:48
so from that starting point
51:50
she writes an entire book covering some
51:53
3,000 years of human history to make the
51:56
case that throw that entire period of
51:59
time for the most part major political
52:02
decisions determining the fates of
52:04
societies and cultures are made not
52:07
based whatsoever in reason but rather on
52:10
the other subtle influences that were
52:14
here to talk to look she asks why do
52:16
holders of high office so often act
52:18
contrary to reason why does intelligent
52:22
mental process so often seem not to
52:25
function ask yourself that wooden
52:30
headedness plays a remarkably large role
52:32
in government it consists of assessing a
52:35
situation in terms of preconceived fixed
52:38
notions think political ideology
52:41
religious dogma disciplinary paradigm
52:45
these are preconceived fixed notions we
52:48
have
52:49
struck did perhaps based on evidence
52:52
perhaps not but we've come to agreement
52:54
that this is the way things are and we
52:58
act out of them despite evidence to the
53:00
contrary
53:01
so we assess a situation in terms of our
53:04
preconceived ideological or dogmas while
53:08
ignoring any contrary science it is
53:10
acting according to which while not
53:12
allowing oneself to be deflected by the
53:16
facts and we now have a game to bring a
53:20
little more biology into this a fairly
53:22
good understanding of the what you might
53:26
call the cognitive neurological basis
53:29
for this kind of behavior I'll refer you
53:33
to another little book this one is
53:35
called the brain and culture by Luce
53:37
Wexler
53:38
there are many volumes that draw this
53:41
particular conclusion but this is a
53:43
particularly accessible one's brain and
53:46
culture and what Wexler are used based
53:51
on countless countless book many many
53:53
experiments is that when people are
53:56
exposed repeatedly to the same set of
54:00
convictions beliefs values and
54:02
assumptions in the course of our
54:03
education in the course of being brought
54:05
up in a household in the course of
54:07
political activity or whatever it might
54:09
be those beliefs values and assumptions
54:12
literally help to shape a set of
54:15
synaptic circuits in the brain such that
54:18
reference to any element of that total
54:21
belief set will set the whole system off
54:23
like a Christmas tree so being literally
54:27
wire people up and if you've been raised
54:29
say in a household in which your parents
54:32
have been you know capitalist captains
54:37
for some period of time and you're well
54:39
steeped in the rhetoric of the far right
54:41
then simply mentioning something like
54:43
free trade or globalization the entire
54:45
circuitry that's associated with the
54:48
variety of intellectual concepts around
54:52
those ideas is laid out so it's not that
54:56
different actually from learning to pay
54:57
a musical instrument I happen to be used
55:01
to be an oboe player
55:02
I didn't have to stop and think about
55:04
every note and where my finger placement
55:06
was after you've done something ten
55:08
thousand times it's automatic it just
55:10
leaps to your fingers right off the page
55:12
and our thought processes are not that
55:15
different but here's the kicker and I
55:17
think this is something we have to take
55:19
seriously into account once these
55:22
synaptic circuits the spot pattern this
55:24
ideological positioning is in place it
55:27
becomes the filter through which all
55:30
incoming information is driven so that
55:33
when faced with information direct quote
55:36
that does not agree with these preformed
55:39
internal circuits they deny we tend to
55:42
deny discredit reinterpret or forget
55:45
that information so look at the
55:49
compounding layers of complexity that
55:52
come to us when it comes to facing
55:54
something like climate change we have a
55:57
predisposition to be this way
55:59
it's overlaying with a socially
56:02
constructed growth act that that
56:03
reinforces the worst aspects of the
56:06
biological predisposition that has been
56:08
idiot logically entrained in our brains
56:11
by several decades now of the neoliberal
56:14
mantra of free markets you know
56:18
deregulation and on and on and on to the
56:20
point where our whole culture is being
56:22
dissembled or deconstructed we're losing
56:25
local support for planning actions and
56:28
so on and so forth on the grounds that
56:29
the market should be the arbiter of all
56:31
social value and so on and so forth and
56:34
to contradict that means political death
56:37
and yet it's nothing more than a
56:40
construct a product of the human mind
56:44
with no basis in reality and certainly
56:47
one that is confounding our efforts
56:49
toward policies that would encourage our
56:52
collective survival the problem is that
56:56
we can't even get an adult conversation
56:57
about what needs to be done in
57:02
international circles because everyone
57:05
at the table by definition only got
57:08
there by subscribing to the accepted
57:10
cultural paradigm and once they all
57:15
agree on what that is
57:16
any contrary information will be
57:21
discredited denied forgotten or
57:24
reinterpreted to sustain the status quo
57:30
so what would a truly now listen this is
57:33
our challenge if we're so damn smart
57:36
what should we be doing instead
57:39
what would a compassionate intelligent
57:42
forward-looking species do in response
57:44
to the historical record and ongoing
57:46
trends well I would argue we need to
57:50
rewrite the cultural narrative now I've
57:53
made a lot of emphasis or put a lot of
57:55
emphasis on biological predispositions
57:57
being reinforced by cultural narratives
58:00
there's not much we can do about certain
58:02
biological predispositions but we can
58:05
create a counterculture a culture that
58:08
tends to discourage those biological
58:11
predispositions and we do that all the
58:13
time
58:14
civilization is a set of rules and
58:17
regulations to force upon us behaviors
58:21
that we are not predisposed to
58:23
performing how many of you are married
58:25
how many of you have a wedding ring how
58:28
many of you went through a ceremony the
58:31
purpose of which is to signal to the
58:34
rest of society that you're not
58:37
available that you're committed to this
58:39
individual and so on humans are not
58:41
monogamous species we have to create
58:44
cultural institutions to suppress
58:46
behaviors which would otherwise be
58:48
expressed and make the kind of
58:50
civilization we have utterly impossible
58:52
so this is by no means a unique
58:56
circumstance but we have to take it on
58:59
we have to recognize what it is that is
59:02
holding us back and consciously come
59:04
together with that recognition to
59:07
reconstruct a social narrative that will
59:11
lend itself to our survival and that
59:15
means we shift from efficiency and
59:17
growth which is just getting bigger you
59:19
notice that the economy gets bigger and
59:21
bigger but most of us are not any better
59:23
off what intelligence species would do
59:27
that when the option is to get
59:30
better qualitatively improve the quality
59:33
of life for most individuals so there's
59:38
a difference between sustainable growth
59:40
and sustainable development sustainable
59:42
growth is an oxymoron but sustainable
59:44
development is not you can get better
59:46
without getting any bigger and in nature
59:50
growth isn't juvenile phase in the
59:53
development of any organ organism
59:57
population or ecosystem we must shift
60:01
our underpinning values from competitive
60:04
individualism greed narrow self-interest
60:06
toward community cooperation and our
60:09
collective interests in surviving you
60:12
cannot imagine a world surviving in
60:16
which we continue to compete at the
60:19
individual and international level for
60:21
the declining resources and so on and so
60:23
forth but you can imagine if we learn to
60:27
cooperate that we can pull this off and
60:33
again almost everybody who looks at this
60:36
seriously comes to this rather dramatic
60:39
conclusion this first statement is by
60:43
the World Business Council on
60:44
sustainable development so it's not a
60:46
flaky outfit dedicated to you know
60:50
shutting down the planet this is the
60:51
World Business Council on sustainable
60:54
development who pulled together a group
60:56
of scientists and specialists on these
60:59
issues in the early 90s in Belgium and
61:03
flirt and came up with this assessment
61:06
look the world is fine mate it has a
61:09
finite capacity to absorb waste it is a
61:11
finite capacity produce even renewable
61:13
resources and work undermining the basis
61:16
of renewable 'ti even it's also an
61:19
inequitable world in which the rich are
61:21
getting richer the middle class is
61:23
disappearing in the poorest of the poor
61:25
are worse off now than they were 20
61:27
years ago so if we are serious about
61:29
sustainability even in the rather
61:31
trivial Brundtland definition and we
61:35
want to have an ecologically sustainable
61:37
world with a degree of social equity
61:39
then this is the conclusion they came to
61:43
a 90% reduction in energy and material
61:47
throughput in osed countries by the
61:50
middle of this century to achieve
61:52
sustainability equitably on a finite
61:54
planet our eco footprint analysis is
61:57
actually more conservative than that
61:59
I've argued over and over again in
62:02
recent writings that for sustainability
62:04
with equity wealthy oacd countries
62:07
should be taking step to reduce their
62:08
ecological footprint by about 50 percent
62:11
to 80 percent that is to say we have to
62:14
consume vastly less energy and material
62:18
resources than we do now in the rich
62:21
countries simply to create ecological
62:24
space for necessary growth in the very
62:27
poorest countries now again this assumed
62:28
you want equity to be part of this
62:30
equation
62:31
the alternative is for us to hold our
62:33
course and simply dismiss literally kill
62:37
off two or three or four billion people
62:40
with whom we happen to share the planet
62:43
now in the last few years this idea is
62:46
beginning to take hold in some circles
62:48
this is just a small sample of books I
62:51
pulled off my shelf to photograph for
62:53
this meeting on the question of D growth
62:56
or shrinking the world economy a
63:00
prosperous way down by a couple of
63:03
ecologists this is Tim Jackson's
63:05
prosperity without growth Tim Jackson
63:08
until very recently was the chair of the
63:11
UK government sustainability Council
63:13
okay
63:14
which by the way was dissolved shortly
63:16
after he published this finding and some
63:19
would argue that it's because it came
63:21
right up against the principle paradigm
63:24
British government around what is meant
63:29
by sustainability another good friend of
63:31
mine is Professor Peter Victor's an
63:33
ecological economist at York University
63:35
in Toronto and Canada managing without
63:39
growth this is the only economist who
63:41
has ever taken a standard natural
63:43
economic model and manipulated with real
63:46
data from the Canadian government to
63:48
show that we could have a zero growth
63:50
economy within
63:51
years with no unemployment and no
63:53
poverty should we choose to take the
63:56
fundamental principles of sustainability
63:58
seriously and apply them in a context
64:01
that has true meaning here and so on
64:04
growth isn't possible you might know
64:06
about the New Economics foundation
64:13
prosperity with those growth should not
64:16
be painful this is just one graphic of
64:20
many many we've died did he be this
64:22
precise one but my students calculated
64:24
the same curve for almost every index
64:27
going into the Human Development Index
64:29
this happens to be a plot of per capita
64:31
income in the countries of the world
64:34
versus longevity now clearly there's an
64:38
advantage to having money you can get
64:40
food clothing and shelter and the better
64:43
you get of food clothing and shelter the
64:46
longer you live so early on in the
64:50
growth of an economy situations steadily
64:53
improve longevity increases as does
64:57
post-operative survival literacy rates
65:00
all of those kind of businesses but in
65:04
every case the curve looks like this
65:06
it's a slope of diminishing returns a
65:09
point is reached beyond which there's no
65:12
further performance in terms of these
65:15
purely objective variables not purely
65:19
objective because obviously we had to
65:20
choose them so there's some value there
65:22
the point is longevity is something we
65:24
can measure and an intelligent species
65:27
might look at this curve and say well if
65:30
the objective of the exercise is to
65:31
improve social well-being on any of
65:34
these indicators there's an optimal
65:36
point beyond which there are no further
65:40
games ok and if we look at the
65:43
subjective side of things I didn't have
65:45
the time there's a wonderful new book by
65:47
an wonderful British sociologist Richard
65:52
Wilkinson and Kate Pickett called the
65:54
spirit level and they show over and over
65:57
and over again things like I have on the
66:00
right in Canada between 2 9
66:04
76 and 2006 over a 30 year period we saw
66:08
a hundred and thirty percent growth in
66:11
the economy is an exponential growth
66:13
rate in excess of 2% per capita income
66:17
is 70% higher that's a remarkable
66:19
achievement yet by the way the purpose
66:23
of Road over and over again is to solve
66:25
poverty and abuse unemployment right we
66:27
got a girl we've got to keep the
66:28
employment well we saw this remarkable
66:32
growth in Canada through this very
66:34
typical of many countries no change in
66:36
the percentage of people employed no
66:39
change in the percentage of the
66:40
population in poverty but the absolute
66:42
numbers of both have increased
66:44
remarkably so again what are we
66:48
achieving here meanwhile subjective
66:51
well-being how people feel about
66:53
themselves their families in the future
66:55
is in rapid decline again I refer you to
66:59
Wilkinson and picket or tremendous
67:02
detail on that kind of score so again
67:05
ask yourself how would an intelligent
67:07
forward-thinking species respond to
67:10
these kinds of data cognitive steps or
67:16
religion Oh mais public planning for
67:18
example we cannot do sustainability as
67:21
individuals it's a collective problem
67:24
requiring collective solutions abandon
67:27
the cult of consumerism it's constructed
67:30
anyway there's a multi-billion dollar
67:33
advertising industry dedicated to
67:36
turning us all into consuming machines
67:38
in fact there's a marvelous history of
67:40
this I wish we had several hours to
67:42
discuss it we are among the single most
67:45
socially engineered generations when
67:48
about three of them ever to want this
67:50
planet literally having been converted
67:53
from citizens to consumers with a role
67:55
in the economy that consists simply of
67:57
using stuff up as rapidly as it can be
68:00
produced we have to recognize that
68:02
government intervention is absolutely
68:04
legitimate where market failure occurs
68:06
any good economist would tell you this
68:08
but they've been so cowed by the current
68:11
myth but they don't dare market failure
68:17
is climate change the greatest single
68:20
example market failure ever to confound
68:23
the human species we need ecological
68:25
fiscal reform we need to develop
68:28
policies around something called the
68:30
storm sustainability criteria you cannot
68:33
live if you don't have any agricultural
68:35
land but your share is steadily
68:37
shrinking why aren't we recognizing the
68:41
necessity to maintain an adequate
68:43
agricultural land base instead we insist
68:46
on the principle of near-perfect
68:48
substitution that humans can substitute
68:51
for anything nature provided remember
68:52
our good friend quoted way back at the
68:56
beginning I'm not going to go through
68:58
all of these detail there are many many
69:00
policies that should be in place that
69:03
could bring us out of this mess if we
69:05
choose to implement them ok why should
69:09
we do these things because as I say
69:12
individual and national interests have
69:14
for the first time ever converged
69:18
individual and our collective interests
69:20
have for the first time in the history
69:22
of our species converge we cannot do
69:25
this on our own we have to do it as a
69:28
collective Enterprise we have to
69:30
understand that failure to act in the
69:33
common good will lead is leading it's
69:35
not a question of will it's happening to
69:37
ecological decay civil insurrection
69:39
beginning already it's happened here in
69:41
Britain in the last year it's happening
69:44
in the North America particularly with
69:46
the Occupy Wall Street movement it's
69:48
just the leading edge of the social
69:50
discontent that necessarily comes from
69:53
deteriorating social conditions at the
69:55
logical conditions and the resentment
69:57
that the relatively impoverished feel
69:59
when they see a 1% taking 80 percent of
70:03
the national income the good news is
70:09
everything that we've talked about on
70:11
the plus side can be achieved I've said
70:15
technology is available we are ingenious
70:18
and we know and I again I refer you
70:21
another book called factor 5 that we
70:24
could readily achieve 75 to 80 percent
70:26
reduction in material and energy you
70:29
should we choose to do so without making
70:32
significant sacrifices to our way of
70:34
life now that assumes that our way of
70:36
life is a good one and that's a whole
70:38
questionable or something negative
70:39
itself but if you want to stick to this
70:41
way of life we can actually achieve the
70:43
necessary reductions using off-the-shelf
70:45
technologies with the appropriate
70:47
policies in place to prevent the rebound
70:49
effect and so on and so forth
70:51
nevertheless we don't even take that
70:54
easy way out the privileged elites with
70:57
the greatest stake in the state is
70:59
called control the policy levers they
71:01
will defend their positions of privilege
71:03
personal esteem political power and
71:06
wealth ordinary people have been conned
71:09
into accepting the expansion to Smith in
71:12
the North American context it's
71:14
astonishing the extent to which people
71:16
are now voting against their own
71:18
interests because of the enormous
71:20
propaganda campaign that has been
71:22
undertaken at an expense of several tens
71:26
of millions of dollars a year to
71:28
convince people the government is bad
71:30
taxes or worse and deregulation is a
71:33
must okay
71:35
we wind up in a situation then where
71:37
society is in paralysis what is
71:39
scientifically necessary is deemed to be
71:42
politically unfeasible
71:44
but what's politically feasible in this
71:46
socially constructed narrative is
71:48
scientifically irrelevant and I deign
71:51
others have come to similar conclusions
71:53
the talbert forum and sweden meets
71:55
annually to discuss issues of major
71:57
importance they in their 2007 meeting
72:01
recognized we have all the tools
72:03
necessary to achieve global
72:06
sustainability with that clear do we
72:11
know what to do probably yes will we do
72:13
it probably not
72:15
what an awful condemnation of a species
72:19
that purports to be rational intelligent
72:22
capable of forming for forward planning
72:24
and capable of making moral judgments
72:30
this is a serious charge because
72:33
maladaptive means maladaptive social
72:36
constructs will be selected out just as
72:41
maladaptive genetic
72:42
mutations we are now at the point where
72:45
once again we are confronted with the
72:48
possibility that a global civilization
72:50
this time which is constructed itself on
72:54
a set of beliefs values and customs and
72:57
assumptions incompatible with the
73:00
fundamental biophysical context which in
73:03
which we live will be selected out and
73:06
what I really want to underscore is that
73:08
this is the pattern of history two more
73:12
books Joseph Tainter the collapse of
73:15
complex societies and Jared Diamond
73:19
collapse how societies choose to fail or
73:23
succeed both describe the situation we
73:26
are in with great detail they don't do
73:29
it intentionally because they're talking
73:30
about other societies but anyone who
73:33
reads these books can draw the parallels
73:35
and recognize we're on this classical
73:37
track that seems almost to be the
73:39
inevitable that human societies follow
73:42
the advantage we have is discussing it
73:46
like this knowing what happened to them
73:48
and knowing we have the capacities to
73:51
pull this around to change the pattern
73:53
that we choose to do so and what's the
73:56
pattern Joseph Tainter what is most
73:59
intriguing in the evolution of human
74:01
societies is the regularity with which
74:03
the pattern of increasing complexity is
74:05
interrupted by collapse so I invite you
74:09
to join me in proving painters and the
74:14
tall bird for wrong let's rise to the
74:17
challenge of exercising those qualities
74:20
that make us truly human because if we
74:22
fail to do so we're simply listening to
74:25
the beasts within and are no better than
74:27
the reptilian brain stem that we've
74:29
inherited from Kennedy thank you very
74:33
