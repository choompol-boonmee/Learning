I don't always listen to podcasts but
00:04
when I do I listen to stem talk
00:07
interviewing the most interesting people
00:09
in the world of science and technology
00:13
stay curious my friends welcome to stem
00:21
talkin times that stem motto stem tech
00:23
stem tuck welcome to stem talk where we
00:26
introduce you to fascinating people who
00:28
passionately inhabit the scientific and
00:30
technical frontiers of our society I'm
00:32
stem Tacos dhankor Negus and also
00:35
joining us is dr. ken ford ih MCS
00:37
director hi dawn great to be here with
00:40
you on stem talk so today we have a
00:42
super interview that Ken and Dominic
00:45
D'Agostino recently conducted with dr.
00:47
mark Matson I played hooky on this one
00:49
but left it in their able hands dr.
00:52
Madsen is a leader in understanding the
00:53
cellular and molecular mechanisms
00:55
underlying neuronal plasticity in
00:57
neurodegenerative disorders and has made
01:00
major contributions to understanding the
01:02
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease
01:03
Parkinson's disease ALS and stroke in
01:06
addition to his interest in discovering
01:09
the underlying mechanisms of these
01:10
diseases mark is focused on prevention
01:13
and treatment in this episode Mark Ken
01:16
and Dom get into lots of fascinating
01:17
topics to include longevity intermittent
01:21
fasting ketones ketogenic diets protein
01:24
in the diet Alzheimer's Parkinson's
01:26
sarcopenia and much else intermittent
01:29
fasting has become very popular these
01:32
days in mark Matson is in our view the
01:35
premier authority on this matter but
01:38
before we get to today's interview we
01:40
have some housekeeping to take care of
01:41
first we really appreciate all of you

thousands of other stem talk listeners
02:55
who have helped make stem talk a success
02:57
right out of the gate okay now onto
02:59
today's interview with dr. Marc Matson
03:01
dr. Marc Matson is chief of the
03:04
laboratory of neurosciences at the
03:06
National Institute on Aging he is also a
03:09
professor of neuroscience at Johns
03:11
Hopkins University
03:13
Marc has published more than 700
03:15
peer-reviewed articles in leading
03:17
journals and books and has edited 10
03:20
books in the area of neuronal signal
03:22
transduction neural degenerative
03:24
disorders and mechanisms of aging dr.
03:28
Mattson is among a handful of the very
03:31
most highly cited neuro scientists in
03:33
the world dr. Mattson has done seminal
03:36
work and produced major advances in the
03:39
fields of neuroscience and
03:40
neurodegenerative disorders sometimes
03:44

03:47
welcome to stem talk Marc good to see
03:49
you this nice to be here Ken our
03:51
pleasure dr. Mattson when did your
03:55
interest in Aging begin it really began
03:58
in ninth grade when as writing an essay
04:02
for a class I had and I decided to write
04:05
it on cryopreservation cryonics and you
04:11
know this is ninth grade a very
04:12
interesting that's still from the
04:14
standpoint of human science fiction but
04:16
the idea is that you can preserve the
04:19
body and brain forever here indefinitely
04:22
and then bring back to life you know so
04:24
you could stop aging that way but then
04:27
from a scientific standpoint I really
04:29
got interested in aging when I was doing
04:31
my post doctoral research which was in
04:34
developmental neurobiology and we were
04:37
studying the mechanisms that regulate
04:40
the formation of neuronal circuits
04:42
during development and also we're
04:44
studying a cell death because it turns
04:46
out that during brain development many
04:49
more neurons are initially generated
04:52
that end up surviving and so as the
04:55
circuits are refined neurons die so that
04:58
got me interested in cell death and the
05:01
other end of life old age neurons can
05:05
die particularly dramatic fashion in
05:08
Alzheimer's Parkinson's disease and so
05:11
on
05:12
well how then did you go from there
05:17
to your present position at the ni√±a
05:20
okay so my postdoc after getting my PhD
05:24
at the University of Iowa I did postdoc
05:26
research in Colorado and there we were
05:30
discovering that neurotransmitters which
05:32
at that time this is in the late 70s
05:35
early 80s were thought to act only its
05:39
synapses been the adult brain we found
05:41
they were playing an important role in
05:43
guiding the growth of axons and
05:45
dendrites and in the formation of
05:46
synapses and so then I discovered for
05:52
example that the main excitatory
05:53
neurotransmitter in the main brain which
05:55
is called glutamate can regulate
05:58
dendrite outgrowth I got interested in
06:00
how proteins called neuro trophic
06:02
factors can interact with
06:04
neurotransmitters to sculpt if you will
06:07
the formation of neural circuits and
06:09
then we got interested in cell death
06:12
because it turns out if glutamate
06:15
receptors are over activated can
06:18
actually kill neurons and that's very
06:20
important in conditions such as stroke
06:22
for example when cells don't have enough
06:24
energy or in traumatic brain injury then
06:29
if they're continued to be excited when
06:31
they don't have enough energy
06:33
they may die so then I was recruited to
06:38
the University of Kentucky and I was on
06:41
the faculty there in Lexington for 11
06:43
years and that's where I really got my
06:45
own research program going in the
06:48
sanders-brown Center on Aging Colonel
06:51
Sanders and John Y Brown is a governor
06:55
this state amazing yeah so much of your
07:00
research is focused on the benefits of
07:02
fasting or intermittent energy
07:05
restriction especially on reducing the
07:08
risk of neurodegenerative diseases so
07:12
when you touched on it a little bit what
07:13
what are some of the mechanisms by which
07:15
this works
07:17
yeah so the simple notion is that if you
07:21
challenge yourself and your cells
07:24
including your brain cells
07:25
intermittently bio energetically either
07:28
for exercise or fasting that the nerve
07:32
cells respond adaptively and pathways
07:36
are activated that increase the
07:39
resistance of the neurons to more severe
07:42
stress and perhaps resistance to
07:44
age-related neroli jerem disorders so
07:47
this all started when I was at Kentucky
07:49
and since we were interested in aging in
07:53
general it had been known for a long
07:55
time that one way to increase the
07:57
lifespan of rats and mice is to reduce
08:00
their energy intake and well whereas
08:03
most labs do that by reducing daily
08:06
calorie intake you know counting
08:08
calories each day we started subjecting
08:11
animals to alternate day fasting where
08:13
one day they have no food for 24 hours
08:16
the next day they can eat again and if
08:18
you repeat that for one the beginning
08:21
when the animals are young they'll live
08:22
up to 30% longer and then we found we
08:25
have many different models that are
08:29
relevant to neroli jerem disorders like
08:30
Parkinson's Alzheimer's and even acute
08:34
degenerative conditions like stroke or
08:36
severe epileptic seizures and we found
08:38
that rats or mice maintained on this
08:41
alternate day fasting diet their nerve
08:44
cells were more resistant to
08:46
degenerating
08:47
and the functional outcome was better in
08:49
the animals on fasting compared to
08:52
animals that hate everyday and just to
08:55
clarify the the days that they're eating
08:58
it was ad libitum that's right right and
09:00
their overall calorie intake though is
09:03
reduced somewhat in other words they
09:04
don't eat twice as much food on the days
09:06
they do have food as they normally would
09:08
so they're about anywhere from 10 to 25%
09:12
calorie restricted does that vary
09:16
between strains of animals it does yeah
09:20
there's interesting I understand that
09:22
you conducted a National Institute on
09:25
Aging study that looked at two groups of
09:27
obese women at elevated risk of breast
09:31
cancer in the UK where the women eating
09:34
a 200 calorie a day diet twice a week
09:37
fared better than the women eating a
09:39
calorie restricted daily diet do I have
09:42
that right and could this 5:2 approach
09:45
be useful for people in other conditions
09:48
now this study was done as a
09:51
collaboration between dr. Michele Harvey
09:53
and University of Manchester and in my
09:55
own lab and she's a dietician that has a
09:59
strong interest in breast cancer and so
10:02
she saw her work in animals and we
10:05
talked about a human study and so what
10:08
was done is that about a hundred women
10:10
were divided into two diet groups and
10:13
after getting information on their basal
10:16
diets and their estimated calorie intake
10:18
we divided them into two groups one
10:20
group they ate 25% fewer calories each
10:23
day by counting calories at each meal
10:25
the other group we had them two days a
10:28
week and in this study was consecutive
10:30
days eat only 500 calories and this is
10:35
six-month study and about 80 more than
10:39
80 percent of the women made it through
10:41
the six months and and most of them had
10:45
dropped out because of the diet dropped
10:47
out in the first month if they got by
10:50
the first month they they were losing
10:53
weight feeling better and they stuck
10:54
with it the take-home message from the
10:58
study was that the women on what's now
11:00
called the five
11:01
two diets they lost more belly fat and
11:04
they retain more lean mass and they also
11:08
had bigger improvement in glucose
11:12
regulation as indicated by increased in
11:15
insulin sensitivity compared to the
11:17
women who were counting calories each
11:18
day and that's consistent with what we
11:21
know about fasting in terms of general
11:25
energy metabolism if you eat 3 meals a
11:28
day and plus snacks as a lot of people
11:31
do in this country every time you eat
11:33
the energy goes into your liver glucose
11:37
goes in your liver it's stored in the
11:39
form of glycogen and that's always
11:41
tapped into first and it takes upwards
11:45
of 10 hours to completely deplete
11:47
glycogen stores so most people never
11:50
deplete their glycogen stores and but
11:53
what happens then if you go long or say
11:56
1216 hours or more not eating anything
11:59
then you mobilize fatty acids and they
12:04
go into the blood into the liver and
12:06
converted to what are called ketones and
12:08
ketones are a really good energy source
12:11
alternative energy source for cells
12:13
including neurons so we think that these
12:18
differences we saw were mainly due to
12:20
this energetic shift where the women on
12:22
the 5:2 diet were if you will burning
12:24
fat whereas a women who just reduced
12:27
daily calorie intake but ate regular
12:29
meals didn't follow me up on that could
12:32
everyone not just people with identified
12:35
health risks therefore benefit or
12:37
potentially benefit from fasting there
12:43
haven't been a controlled trials and
12:45
humans done in people who are not
12:47
overweight to my knowledge and so this
12:51
is needed what I can tell you though is
12:54
that based on animal studies we think
12:56
it's very likely that even animals and
13:00
possibly humans who are normal weight
13:02
may show some benefits from intermittent
13:05
fasting particularly for the brain and
13:09
from an evolutionary perspective it
13:12
makes sense that if you're hungry and
13:14
having
13:15
able to find food figure out how to find
13:17
food for a while that your brain better
13:19
be functioning well and we find this is
13:22
clearly true in animals and where we
13:25
have some insight into actually what's
13:27
happening in the nerve cell circuits and
13:29
at the molecular level that explains why
13:31
the animals an intermittent fasting diet
13:34
have better cognitive performance even
13:38
if they're not old and don't have a
13:40
disease hmm please discuss if you would
13:45
various approaches to intermittent
13:47
fasting you know one sees compressed
13:50
feeding windows or every other day
13:53
fasting there must be some pros and cons
13:56
and also do you see a role in this in
13:59
intermittent fasting for exhaustion Asst
14:01
ketones or for medium chain
14:05
triglycerides could you talk about this
14:07
topic sort of generally how you
14:09
recommend intermittent fast be
14:11
structured yeah well I don't make any
14:13
specific recommendations but I can tell
14:16
you that there are as far as human
14:19
studies there's been three different
14:21
approaches the 5:2 diet alternate day
14:25
fasting which is actually a alternate
14:28
days eating only about five or six
14:30
hundred calories and that's by Christa
14:32
Verity
14:32
University of Chicago Illinois Chicago
14:35
and then the other approach is what's
14:38
called time restricted feeding where you
14:41
limit the time window each day that you
14:43
take in calories to about six to eight
14:46
hours there's an investigator at the
14:49
Salk Institute Sachin panda who's a
14:52
circadian rhythm biologist and he did
14:56
some nice work in animals first showing
14:58
that if you restrict the time period
15:00
that they have access to food to eight
15:02
hours every 24 hours you can feed them a
15:05
high-fat diet and they won't get fat
15:09
compared to the animals that have access
15:12
to food 24 hours interestingly even
15:14
though both groups eat the same amount
15:16
of food and then he recently did a study
15:20
where he had a postdoc who wrote a
15:24
cellphone app
15:26
and and then they gave this cell phone
15:31
app to like 150 free living subjects out
15:34
there San Diego area and they were
15:37
instructed to every time they ate
15:39
something or drank something take a
15:40
picture of it and then the picture went
15:43
to the postdoc at the Salk Institute and
15:45
then it didn't stay on their phone and
15:46
what they found they had a paper in the
15:48
journal Cell Metabolism recently where
15:51
they found like 80 to 90 percent of the
15:55
subjects put something caloric in their
15:58
mouth from the time they got up until
16:00
they went to bed in other words they get
16:02
up beat something eat lunch snack dinner
16:06
eat something in the evening pretty much
16:09
the only time they weren't taking
16:10
anything caloric was when they're
16:11
sleeping you know so they're going like
16:14
14 16 hours they're eating something so
16:17
they're only the only time they're
16:19
fasting is when they're sleeping so we
16:20
think that and this is occurring
16:23
obviously on the background of obesity
16:26
in this country is occurring with people
16:30
with these kinds of eating patterns so
16:33
we had a workshop on this two years ago
16:36
and then we published a paper in PNAS
16:39
based on the workshop that talks about
16:43
it's kind of summarizes the the research
16:47
having to do with meal frequency and
16:50
timing and health and what's known what
16:54
isn't known what our myths for example
16:58
that breakfast is the most important
17:00
meal a day and that you're not you're
17:02
not going to be healthy if you don't eat
17:04
breakfast and you know that there's
17:08
other kinds of if you will miss for
17:11
example that it's healthier to eat a lot
17:13
of small meals rather than eat one or
17:17
two big meals and largely this isn't
17:20
based on any good science that we can
17:24
find and so if listeners are interested
17:26
they can track down that article great
17:30
do you see a role for ketogenic fats or
17:33
exogenous ketones when coupled wisely
17:36
you know couple carefully with a
17:38
intermittent fasting uh possibly fasting
17:44
fasting can elevate ketones to levels
17:47
that are pretty high and actually higher
17:49
than you get with a typical ketogenic
17:51
diet now some of the more recent
17:54
approaches that are being tested mainly
17:56
experimentally have to do with ketones
17:58
esters and dieters and these will
18:03
elevate ketones up into the range you
18:05
get with fasting so but as far as adding
18:10
on ketogenic diets or for example ketone
18:14
ester supplementation with fasting
18:18
studies need to be done
18:20
can't really say until the studies are
18:22
done and this is kind of generally true
18:24
with this whole field that they're been
18:27
caught up quite a few animal studies
18:29
done a few controlled human studies done
18:32
lot of anecdotal things floating around
18:34
on the internet but much more needs to
18:37
be done in rigorously controlled trials
18:39
and sort of on that topic you discuss
18:43
the benefits of ketones in your TED talk
18:46
and to what extent do ketones
18:49
particularly beta-hydroxybutyrate
18:52
account for some of the beneficial
18:54
effects of fasting can you speculate on
18:56
it now that's something we're very
18:58
interested in particularly from the
19:00
brain aspect and it's been known for a
19:05
long time and in my TED talk I put up a
19:08
slide in Roman times in Greek times when
19:11
people had epileptic seizures and were
19:13
having convulsions they thought they
19:14
were possessed by demons and they found
19:17
if they shut them in a room for a few
19:19
days the demons go away and very likely
19:21
what's happening is they're fasting the
19:24
hydroxybutyrate acetoacetate levels are
19:27
going up and that suppressing the
19:29
seizures so we know that and as you know
19:33
ketogenic diets are still used in some
19:35
patients with epilepsy and they work so
19:38
it's known that hydroxy butyrate and
19:40
acetoacetate can be metabolized to
19:43
acetyl coenzyme a and then used to
19:46
produce ATP in cells including neurons
19:49
so that's kind of the conventional
19:52
thinking of
19:52
how these ketone bodies are an energy
19:56
source but recent findings from other
19:58
labs and our lab as well suggest that
20:01
for example beta-hydroxybutyrate has
20:04
signaling functions other labs Eric
20:06
Burdon for example has shown that
20:09
hydroxy butyrate can inhibit certain
20:11
protein deacetylases we have found
20:15
recently and presented this at the
20:17
Society for Neuroscience and we're
20:18
revising a paper that hydroxy butyrate
20:21
can increase production of a
20:23
neurotrophins the growth survival of
20:28
neurons it's called BDNF brain-derived
20:30
neurotrophic factor and we and others
20:33
had previously shown that both exercise
20:35
and faceting increased BDNF levels in
20:38
the brain
20:40
in fact BDNF we think is we that
20:44
scientific community neuroscience thinks
20:46
is a key mediator of the antidepressant
20:51
effects of exercise as well as the most
20:55
commonly used antidepressant drugs the
20:58
serotonin reuptake inhibitors so we find
21:01
that hydroxy butyrate increases BDNF
21:04
production and it's known that BDNF it's
21:08
important for learning and memory and
21:10
animals if you block BDNF signaling it
21:14
will cause cognitive impairment BDNF is
21:17
important for a process called
21:19
neurogenesis the production of new
21:21
neurons from stem cells and certain
21:23
regions of the brain so the point there
21:27
is that I think that and the way I look
21:31
at this if I can going back to an
21:33
evolutionary perspective okay if you get
21:35
this shift in energy metabolism where
21:37
you've depleted the glycogen stores and
21:39
the animal or us are saying okay we
21:42
better figure out how to find food
21:44
pretty soon that your brain better be
21:48
working well and in addition to
21:50
providing an energy source
21:51
these ketones may be a peripheral signal
21:54
that goes into the brain and stimulates
21:57
signaling pathways that improve
22:00
cognitive function
22:08
stem talk is an educational service of
22:11
the florida institute for human and
22:12
machine cognition a not-for-profit
22:14
research lab pioneering groundbreaking
22:17
technologies aimed at leveraging and
22:19
extending human cognition perception
22:21
locomotion and resilience following up
22:29
on this a 2012 issue in the journal
22:33
neurobiology of aging a team of
22:36
researchers led by Kashi Waya
22:38
and including Richard of each at the NIH
22:41
and yourself published a very
22:43
interesting paper reporting that ketone
22:45
esters had cognitive sparing properties
22:48
and lessened amyloid and tau pathologies
22:51
and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease
22:53
do you see a role for exhaust ketones in
22:57
enhancing brain health or performance
23:00
yes this is an important area research
23:04
from the standpoint of Alzheimer's
23:06
disease and an age-related cognitive
23:08
impairment there's there's interest in
23:13
doing controlled clinical trials to test
23:17
the efficacy of in fact there's one
23:19
going on now with coconut oil there's
23:23
one going on with branched chain amino
23:24
acids we are interested in doing a small
23:28
study with the ketone ester in that
23:31
animal study you mentioned which we were
23:34
part of is actually done in my
23:35
laboratory by by a postdoc that worked
23:40
with dr. beech and so I think this is an
23:44
approach that really needs to be tested
23:47
sooner rather than later as you probably
23:51
know that an Alzheimer's disease there's
23:55
been no treatment that is effective in
23:57
slowing down the disease process there's
23:59
a few drugs that have a very modest
24:03
trenchant beneficial effect in improving
24:05
cognition and they're widely prescribed
24:07
but they're they don't have a big effect
24:10
and they don't affect the neuro
24:12
degenerative process with what these
24:16
age-related diseases the the biggest
24:19
impact will be on risk reduction
24:22
identifying what people can do during
24:25
their midlife that will reduce their
24:28
risk from developing these disorders
24:30
when they get in their 70s or 80s you
24:34
know so I'm not so optimistic that we're
24:36
going to cure if you will Alzheimer's
24:39
disease someone when someone's
24:41
symptomatic because there's already
24:43
tremendous degeneration of nerve cells
24:46
on the other hand I'm very optimistic
24:49
that through diet lifestyle perhaps some
24:54
sort of dietary supplement and
24:57
pharmacological science-based
25:00
pharmacological interventions with safe
25:03
approaches that and and and identifying
25:06
people at risk there's another thing you
25:09
know we're all at risk in a sense
25:11
because the the data now are if you live
25:13
to be in your 80
25:15
you almost have a 50% chance of having
25:18
Alzheimer's disease before you die yeah
25:22
yeah that's a a depressing statistic
25:25
have you uh thoughts on other
25:28
neurodegenerative disorders like
25:31
Parkinson's with respect to fasting or
25:35
ketone esther's yeah so there's good
25:41
evidence that both well it particularly
25:43
exercise a lot of studies in human
25:46
Parkinson's patients that exercise
25:49
programs they benefit from we've done
25:53
some work on intermittent fasting in
25:54
Parkinson's models in mice and the
25:59
intermittent fasting has beneficial
26:00
effects the issue that comes up with
26:04
clinical trials in patients who are
26:06
always already symptomatic I think is a
26:10
valid one that once they're diagnosed
26:14
there they usually start to lose body
26:17
weight both in Alzheimer's and
26:19
Parkinson's disease in fact many cases
26:21
they're starting to lose body weight
26:23
before they're diagnosed so again I
26:25
think that focusing on risk reduction is
26:29
the approach to take but from a
26:31
mechanisms standpoint
26:32
ketones will benefit the neuronal
26:36
populations that are vulnerable and
26:38
degenerate in Parkinson's disease just
26:40
as they benefit the neurons involved in
26:44
learning and memory that are more
26:45
vulnerable in Alzheimer's sarcopenia the
26:49
loss of muscle mass strength and
26:52
function is just a major problem
26:55
associated with aging only last month a
26:58
new article was published in Nature that
27:01
seemed to show that at otha g is a
27:03
critical regulator
27:04
of stem cell fate with implications for
27:07
fostering muscle regeneration in
27:09
sarcopenia at otha g typically declines
27:13
with age and this may cause stem cells
27:15
to lose their so-called stem enos and
27:18
become senescent both intermittent
27:21
fasting and ketosis increase etaf EG
27:25
might this account for some of the
27:27
common benefit
27:28
at one season both of these approaches
27:31
yes what the way we look at this is that
27:35
during the bioenergetic challenge you
27:39
know whether it's at vigorous exercise
27:41
or fasting and I should point out that
27:45
the ketones would you know with extended
27:48
endurance exercise ketones go up to that
27:53
those bio energetic challenges will
27:57
increase otology in part by inhibiting a
28:03
pathway involving a protein called mTOR
28:05
and what this altogether what's
28:09
happening is the cell is going into kind
28:11
of a protective mode it's reducing
28:14
overall protein synthesis and at the
28:18
same time enhancing its ability to
28:20
remove molecular garbage so for example
28:24
proteins that have been damaged by free
28:26
radicals or mitochondria that aren't
28:29
functioning well so during the the
28:32
bioenergetic challenge and possibly in
28:34
response to the ketones you the cell is
28:39
enhancing its ability to cope with
28:41
stress but then very important for for
28:46
growing for the cells to grow whether
28:49
it's muscle cells or nerve cells is a
28:51
recovery period so after fasting eating
28:55
after exercising resting and eating so
28:59
what happens then the cell having gone
29:02
through the bioenergetic challenge of
29:04
exerciser fasting is cleared out the
29:09
garbage and it's ready to grow you
29:12
produce new proteins and grow and so
29:16
during the recovery phase then there's
29:19
increased protein synthesis and growth
29:21
of the muscle cells in the case of
29:23
neurons growth of dendrites and even
29:26
formation of new synapses which we know
29:29
there's have documented occur with
29:31
intermittent fasting diets and also
29:34
exercise that's a great answer thing
29:38
thank you with an eye toward longevity
29:40
and avoiding circle
29:42
Neah what strategies can be employed and
29:46
I think you've touched on is to optimize
29:48
muscle strength while on an intermittent
29:52
fasting protocol and do you think it's
29:54
possible to actually gain muscle while
29:57
intermittent fasting yeah it is possible
30:01
to gain muscle well intermittent fasting
30:02
in in an intermittent fasting is not
30:06
necessarily reducing calories a lot you
30:10
know so for example if you do the time
30:12
restricted feeding well you where you
30:14
eat only during an eight hour time
30:16
window each day one approach is that you
30:19
for example skip breakfast this is kind
30:23
of an easy approach because then you've
30:25
already fasted for the time you've been
30:27
sleeping and then exercise you know
30:30
maybe late morning and then eat after
30:34
that and then eat a normal amount of
30:36
food you know during your eight hour
30:38
time window you know have a healthy diet
30:42
which is important and you know so
30:46
you're not going to lose muscle mass as
30:48
long as you maintain your energy intake
30:52
from the standpoint of aging one one
30:58
aspect of diet that I think is important
31:02
and is should be discussed a lot more is
31:05
protein intake there's quite a bit of
31:07
evidence that high protein intake is not
31:10
good for aging maybe not even for your
31:14
muscles and I mentioned this mTOR
31:18
pathway so if you take in a lot of amino
31:22
acids that will increase mTOR and it
31:27
will reduce autophagy it will inhibit
31:31
the ability of cells to clear out the
31:33
molecular garbage so you know it's a
31:39
little bit counterintuitive because you
31:41
know the conventional wisdom is if you
31:43
want to build muscle you got to take a
31:44
lot of protein in and that may be that
31:48
may be advantageous in the short term
31:51
but for a lifelong maintenance of muscle
31:54
mass
31:55
my own opinion although for the work
31:58
needs to be done is that it's probably
32:00
not a good idea and in fact if you look
32:02
at a lot of these body builders I mean
32:06
you could you could make the argument oh
32:08
maybe they're taking testosterone or
32:10
something but many of them when they get
32:11
older they start to have a lot of health
32:14
issues cropping up you know one sees
32:17
branched chain amino acids and essential
32:20
amino acids often advocated to an aging
32:24
population as a part of the means of
32:28
avoiding sarcopenia and so the you know
32:32
your recent comment just now is sort of
32:35
in opposition to that ah not so much I
32:40
think what you want to do is get their
32:42
ketones up but not necessarily have
32:46
really high levels of proteins right and
32:50
by proteins you're including the amino
32:52
acids right general yeah right yeah of
32:54
course
32:55
do you fast and so I'd like to hear a
33:00
little bit about your race well yeah
33:02
what I do is cut I'm restricted feeding
33:04
type approach I four or five days a week
33:07
I don't eat breakfast or lunch then I'll
33:11
work out mid-afternoon and then eat
33:14
right after that and then need some more
33:15
in the early evening and then the
33:18
weekends you know I'm home with it then
33:19
this is this what will you know fits
33:22
into my workday and and lifestyle and I
33:27
think I'm more productive this way
33:28
because I don't I'm fortunate I guess I
33:31
don't have to go to breakfast with
33:33
people or have to go to lunch with
33:35
people most days and so I'm able to just
33:39
get into the lab early in the morning
33:41
and I drink a lot of green tea but yeah
33:47
so I found that it's not a problem for
33:51
me I don't get hungry in the morning
33:53
start getting a little hungry before I
33:56
exercise and then eat right after
33:58
exercise and I've I've maintained the
34:01
same I've done this for years and I've
34:03
maintained the same body weight for
34:06
actually
34:08
thirty years Wow with that within a few
34:11
pounds and you go into your exercise
34:13
fasted in a fasted State no supplement
34:16
that's interesting I do the same thing I
34:18
have an early dinner skip breakfast and
34:23
go into resistance training usually
34:27
fasted yeah did you do ah you might want
34:33
to say something about what you perceive
34:35
is the benefit of fasted training yeah
34:38
well pretend you're a muscle cell okay
34:42
so you got to think like a muscle okay
34:46
you you've been experiencing low levels
34:50
you know lower end levels of glucose for
34:54
long time 16 18 hours amino acid levels
34:59
are kind of low because you haven't
35:01
eaten anything for 16 you know then
35:04
you're asked to work any work so what
35:11
would be the best your best response to
35:13
ensure that next time this dummy whose
35:16
body you're in finds food that you're
35:20
able to take up the nutrients and
35:23
utilize them to your best advantage and
35:25
the answer is you up regulate glucose
35:29
transporters in your membranes you up
35:32
regulate amino acid transporters so that
35:34
you can quickly move the amino acids in
35:37
when the person is done tracking down
35:40
the prey and eating it so that's the
35:43
idea so it's from there's an
35:46
evolutionary basis of why this makes
35:48
sense that you should be functioning
35:51
well but both cognitively and and
35:54
physically in the fasted State because
35:58
that is with the conditions that for
36:03
example carnivores used to survive if
36:05
your brain wasn't working well when
36:08
you're hungry and if you weren't
36:10
physically fit enough and have endurance
36:13
enough to track down your prey you're
36:15
not going to survive so you know that
36:17
three day three meals a day plus snacks
36:18
is very abnormal from an evolutionary
36:21
perspective
36:22
and there's no really solid scientific
36:28
basis of why eating three meals a day
36:31
might be the healthiest in fact we don't
36:34
think it's the healthiest approach do
36:37
you when you do eat do you try to choose
36:41
foods that will maintain and preserve
36:43
that nutritional ketosis or do you just
36:47
try to get the benefits from from
36:49
fasting alone that's a good question and
36:51
the answer is no I don't maybe I should
36:56
think about that more but I Ida what I
36:59
think's a healthy diet a lot of fruits
37:01
and vegetables nuts meat as fish yogurt
37:06
but I do eat whole grains Oh meal and
37:09
whole wheat and probably I'd say and
37:12
beans
37:15
you know that's I'd say at least half my
37:19
calories are from complex carbohydrates
37:22
either whole grains or beans do you
37:24
avoid me at all
37:26
that's just I don't even I don't meat I
37:28
tend avoid read me read me okay exercise
37:33
is a powerful stimulator of brain
37:36
derived neurotrophic factor BDNF how
37:39
does exercise elevate our moods I think
37:42
you kind of touched on that but yeah
37:44
yeah well so when you exercise it we
37:50
think there's changes that are occurring
37:51
directly in the circuits of your brain
37:54
many nerve cell circuits are more active
37:57
obviously the ones involved in sensory
38:00
motor function but also it turns out
38:03
those involved in cognition are the
38:05
nerve cells themselves are more active
38:07
during exercise and it's been known for
38:10
a long time that activity in neurons
38:13
increases productions of neurotrophic
38:15
factors including BDNF and for example I
38:20
do a lot of trail running and during
38:24
trail running you have to be focused on
38:26
every footstep you take or you're going
38:29
to hit a root or Rock and fall down and
38:32
so then going to evolutionary
38:35
perspective
38:35
of these the the antidepressant effect
38:42
of exercise seems to involve some of the
38:45
same mechanisms that are responsible for
38:47
the cognition promoting effects of
38:51
exercise including increased activity in
38:53
the neural circuits as you know one of
38:57
the the old treatments for depression
39:00
was electroconvulsive shock okay so
39:04
that's a little extreme form of
39:07
increasing activity in neural circuits
39:09
but during exercises you know a much
39:12
milder increase in activity but on the
39:15
other hand some of the same mechanisms
39:17
are going on involving BDNF and as I
39:22
mentioned the most commonly used
39:23
antidepressants are thought to have
39:27
their antidepressant effects through
39:29
BDNF BDNF increases neurogenesis
39:32
increases a number of new neurons and
39:34
increases a number of synapses in
39:36
particularly in the hippocampus which is
39:38
a brain region that's affected in
39:42
depression interesting so there's an
39:44
activity dependent increase in vdf but
39:47
also you alluded to the potential here a
39:49
ketone is not young very very
39:51
interesting I don't always listen to
39:54
podcasts but when I do I listen to stem
39:58
talk interviewing the most interesting
40:01
people in the world of science and
40:04
technology stay curious my friends
40:12
you know in the past you've mentioned
40:14
historical figures with you know really
40:19
good brains high-performing individuals
40:21
who promoted fasting could you tell us a
40:25
little bit about that yeah well the
40:28
person I'll tell you is that I found
40:30
this book called the fasting cure and it
40:34
was written by Upton Sinclair and
40:36
published in 1911 and many your
40:39
listeners may know about in Sinclair
40:42
because he wrote a book called the
40:43
jungle which exposed some of the
40:44
problems in the meatpacking industry
40:46
around the turn of the around 1900 and
40:50
so in this book the fasting here Upton
40:54
Sinclair interviewed about 200 some
40:56
people who had some ailment they went on
41:00
fast of various lengths and intermittent
41:04
nature and yeah almost all of them had
41:07
some had improvement in whatever ailment
41:09
they had but then if you go back as far
41:11
as cognition specifically Plato and
41:15
you're right and his writings you can
41:16
find where he wrote that he did some of
41:19
the best thinking when he was fasting
41:21
certainly people like Gandhi and as you
41:26
know and in many religions fasting is a
41:28
common theme and and and part of it I
41:33
think is because you're you're able to
41:36
think more clearly in the fasted state
41:39
and perhaps contemplate things you might
41:43
not have contemplated when you're in a
41:45
more satisfied front from a energetic
41:52
standpoint State yeah and then there's a
41:57
lot of quotes you can find for example
41:58
Mark Twain he commented that something
42:05
to the fact that you know that the
42:07
physicians make three-quarters of their
42:10
money on essentially people who overeat
42:16
and that fasting there for like 75
42:21
percent of physicians where would
42:23
is their jobs as if people were due to
42:26
fast regularly totally agree with you
42:29
so if fasting is is so good for us why
42:34
have we been told to eat three meals a
42:37
day and even as of late why are we told
42:41
to eat kind of mini meals throughout the
42:42
day so what's your why is this
42:45
information being given to it well I
42:48
think that the three meals a day
42:50
probably started I'm not an expert on
42:53
this but in what I've read started with
42:56
Agricultural Revolution where people
42:58
were working very hard farming every day
43:01
and it was a practical approach they had
43:03
a high energy demand because a lot of
43:06
physical labor so they eat when they got
43:08
up then they'd work hard for four or
43:10
five hours take a break
43:12
eat more discuss what work they're going
43:14
to do in the afternoon work more than
43:16
any s'more and then that does kind of
43:18
stuck with it in civilized societies
43:20
agricultural societies then as far as
43:23
eating a lot of small meals my
43:25
impression at least one impetus for that
43:28
advice
43:30
came from work with diabetes patients
43:33
and and with the knowledge of insulin
43:36
and the role of insulin glucose
43:38
regulation and and the idea there is
43:41
that the thinking was it's important to
43:44
avoid big spikes in glucose so if you
43:48
just need small a lot of small meals
43:50
then you'll get you know more frequent
43:54
smaller increases in elevation and
43:56
glucose and maybe that's better for you
43:58
in the long run but on the other hand
43:59
it's very clear from experimental
44:02
studies that many small meals is not as
44:06
effective as intermittent fasting and
44:08
improving insulin sensitivity and then
44:12
as far as breakfast
44:16
one aspect of that has to do with
44:18
studies done in school-age children
44:20
where they will take kids who most all
44:25
normally eat breakfast and then one day
44:26
they'll take half of them and have them
44:29
not eat breakfast the other half will
44:31
eat breakfast and then midday they do
44:33
some behavioral tests and they find lo
44:35
and behold
44:37
kids who didn't eat breakfast are more
44:39
irritable and can't concentrate on their
44:41
work as well well yeah they're hungry
44:45
but I would submit if they had never
44:48
eaten breakfast in capita today if they
44:52
were adapted if they were adapted to it
44:54
they'd be fine and would do as well or
44:56
better than the other kids
44:58
so how long does it take the average
45:02
person to adjust to a regular fasting
45:04
regimen and could this be a treatment
45:07
for obesity and in the studies we did
45:10
with Michelle Harvey and and also we did
45:13
it study in asthma patients about him
45:16
within a month
45:18
yeah it seemed like three weeks to a
45:20
month seems like a tipping point the
45:23
women in the study in England that led
45:28
to the 5:2 diet at when we gave them
45:33
questionnaires they could score their
45:36
mood and their hunger rate their hunger
45:38
and so it's about three weeks to a month
45:41
by then their mood was improving and
45:44
they were no longer hungry on the days
45:47
they were having a very low energy
45:49
intake
45:51
so it's kind of similar to exercise if
45:54
you've been sedentary and then try to go
45:56
run five miles you're not going to feel
45:58
very good it takes a while for you to
46:00
get in shape I would propose that it
46:03
also takes you a while to get in shape
46:05
for fasting the more you do it I think
46:09
the more so out of curiosity what was
46:12
the longest time you ever fasted just
46:15
one day just one day yeah yeah I'm
46:19
curious if you take any supplements to
46:21
if you think supplementation is
46:24
important i I don't anymore okay yeah I
46:28
was on board with it you know that idea
46:30
that that antioxidants are important in
46:34
free radical scavengers and but actually
46:40
25 years ago what became pretty clear
46:42
that that's not right and and in fact we
46:45
published a paper in Scientific American
46:47
this last year where we point out the
46:50
emerging evidence that many of the
46:52
chemicals that in fruits and vegetables
46:55
are good for health may be good for
46:57
health not because they're free radical
46:59
scavengers but because from an
47:01
evolutionary perspective their toxins
47:03
the reason they're produced by the
47:05
plants is to dissuade us and insects
47:10
from eating them so they have a bitter
47:11
typically have
47:12
bitter taste and this is true for for
47:15
many of the actually supplements you get
47:18
now which i think actually that may be
47:21
good so there's certain supplements they
47:23
sulforaphane is one from broccoli or
47:26
curcumin or even caffeine the most
47:29
commonly consumed toxin caffeine is a
47:35
toxin you can kill yourself with
47:37
caffeine and it has a very bitter taste
47:39
and so we think that during evolution
47:43
our cells and organ systems adapted so
47:47
that we could cope with the potentially
47:50
toxic effects of these chemicals and and
47:53
still get the you know calories and
47:56
other nutrients from the plants and so
47:58
if people are interested they can read
48:00
that july 2015 issue of Scientific
48:04
American for that and some I mean some
48:08
do appear to derive some benefit you
48:10
mentioned drinking green tea yeah you
48:12
know a ton of research on EGCG for
48:14
example yeah that the catechins yeah and
48:16
in that and dark chocolate and dark
48:18
chocolate yeah but but again if if you
48:21
if you take everyone knows this you take
48:23
a dark chocolate hundred percent cocoa
48:27
put it's very bitter tasting most people
48:31
can't eat a hundred percent dark
48:33
chocolate and the upper catechins in tea
48:37
if you if you buy the powder epicatechin
48:41
put on your tongue it's all it's very
48:44
off yeah
48:45
yeah make a gag so again these are these
48:46
are chemicals that have a mild noxious
48:49
effect and interestingly that during
48:52
evolution we developed enzymes in our
48:55
lever that rapidly metabolized all these
48:57
naturally occurring chemicals so they're
49:00
only in our system a short time period
49:02
and then they're removed you know so
49:04
there we think they induce a mild
49:06
adaptive stress response and they're
49:08
removed kind of a transient stress
49:10
response similar to transient exercise
49:12
or possibly even passing yeah did you
49:16
talk a little bit more about mTOR as you
49:21
noted there's lots of evidence that
49:22
reducing mTOR is beneficial with respect
49:26
to longevity yet mTOR seems critical for
49:30
muscle protein synthesis and as we age
49:33
which we discussed earlier sarcopenia is
49:36
part of a puzzle and are we doomed to
49:39
sort of uh stir a balancing program here
49:43
or it would be that you intermittently
49:45
depress mTOR or intermittently elevate
49:48
mTOR could you just talk a little bit
49:49
about that yeah I think the your last
49:53
point is right on that the ideal
49:56
scenario seems to be intermittently
49:59
inhibiting mTOR so that you can
50:02
intermittently increase autophagy and
50:05
other mechanisms for removing the
50:07
damaged molecules and then but it's very
50:10
important to also intermittently
50:11
activate mTOR so that the cell can
50:14
produce the new proteins that it needs
50:16
to grow and adapt and function better
50:20
and so I could envision in the future
50:24
that in contrast to the sort of current
50:28
thinking from the pharmaceutical
50:30
industry and drug development where you
50:31
identify a target and then you you
50:36
develop a drug that you can get to stay
50:38
like at a constant level in the blood
50:40
and so you're constantly affecting
50:43
whatever pathway so I think from the
50:46
standpoint of optimizing health that
50:50
approach pharmacological approach would
50:52
be to develop interventions that you
50:55
would administer intermittently you know
50:58
either to inhibit in mTOR intermittently
51:01
or perhaps there's other things we've
51:03
worked a little bit with to deoxy
51:05
glucose which sort of trick cells and
51:08
youth to experiencing the state of
51:11
chloric restriction or fasting if you
51:13
will and and we find in our studies that
51:17
cells are most athletic most healthy if
51:20
you will when they're intermittently
51:22
exposed it to the oxy glucose versus
51:24
more continuously exposed even to a low
51:27
relatively low level up to the x equals
51:30
exercise certainly seems to and exercise
51:33
that's right yeah that's a great answer
51:36
mark could you tell us a little about
51:38
your role at
51:39
the National Institute on Aging yeah so
51:44
my title is chief of the laboratory
51:46
neurosciences so I'm in charge of a
51:49
small group of scientists of about we
51:53
probably have 40 in our group but only
51:58
three of them are senior scientist and
52:02
so the organization of research at NIH
52:05
is such that each Institute National
52:07
Cancer Institute National Institute on
52:09
Aging etc are divided into what are
52:13
called laboratories so a laboratory at
52:15
NIH is equivalent to a department at
52:17
University and a laboratory at NIH is
52:21
headed by a chief which is equivalent to
52:23
a chairman or chairperson
52:26
in a department at a university so the
52:28
organization is similar the terminology
52:31
is a little different so people
52:32
unfamiliar with it you know say lab
52:35
chief well lab C is kind of like a
52:37
department chair
52:38
although the departments smaller than a
52:41
department at a university that's great
52:43
and is there anything else that you'd
52:44
like to talk about where we're together
52:46
here no I guess not
52:51
we covered it yeah we covered a lot I
52:53
have one well but what are your thoughts
52:56
on like short-term fasting for example
52:59
you said this intermittent kind of 2dg
53:01
and it made me think of someone who
53:02
would do that three day or five day fast
53:05
maybe once every month or two yeah and I
53:08
know people there doing this for cancer
53:10
maybe it would push your body to purge
53:11
precancerous also what are your thoughts
53:13
on that I think it's a good idea worth
53:17
pursuing one of my colleagues Valter
53:18
Longo at USC who we wrote a review
53:21
article on fastening together last year
53:24
that he's using that approach right and
53:26
he's most interested in cancer you know
53:30
that's 5:2 diet will michele Harvey now
53:33
is doing a study where women who have
53:36
breast cancer when they're receiving
53:39
chemotherapy and radiation therapy they
53:41
will be placed on either the 5:2 diet or
53:44
a controlled diet during the entire
53:46
course of their therapy and the idea
53:48
there is that most cancer cells rely on
53:51
glucose as an energy
53:53
Torsen are not good at using ketones so
53:57
you know if you're fasting well if that
54:01
if you're fasting and you're the cancer
54:04
cells are being bombarded with toxic
54:07
chemicals or radiation they're much less
54:09
likely to less likely to survive and and
54:14
therefore we think you will be able to
54:16
have a bigger impact on eliminating the
54:18
cancer and that's what's been shown in
54:20
animal studies with intermittent fasting
54:22
it will by itself slow greatly the
54:27
growth of tumors and in combination with
54:30
chemotherapy or radiation therapy can
54:32
what can wipe out the cancer cells much
54:35
better than those treatments alone also
54:37
maybe protect the normals exactly that's
54:39
yeah yeah yeah the normal cells since
54:42
they they can use ketones they are
54:45
responsive to the fasting in terms of
54:48
adaptive stress responses they may be
54:50
more resistant to the adverse effects of
54:52
the cancer treatment so maybe less side
54:55
effects well thank you very much it was
54:57
a great interview and I appreciate you
54:59
doing it yeah thank you again yeah well
55:02
thanks for your great questions can
55:05
guitarist got stems back home stem tank
55:08
stem talk well the interview that you
55:11
and Dom did with mark Matson was
55:13
absolutely full of great information
55:14
clear concise and in-depth mark
55:18
continues to be an impressive thought
55:19
leader in literally every area to which
55:22
he turns his attention and impressive
55:25
fellow DOM and I could have talked with
55:27
him for hours but we restrained
55:28
ourselves as his travel was delayed and
55:31
he didn't arrive at IHMC until the wee
55:34
hours in the morning and right after
55:37
this interview he had a major public
55:39
lecture to give at imc mark is a trooper
55:42
and clearly a resilient guy there must
55:46
be the consequence of his intermittent
55:48
fasting absolutely I invite you to visit
55:51
the stem talk web page where you can
55:53
find the show notes for each episode we
55:55
have provided links to three of mark's
55:56
most relevant papers and to his recent
55:58
public lecture at IHMC you can find us
56:01
at stem
56:02
u.s. this is Don Carnegie signing off
56:05
for now and this is Ken Ford saying
56:07
goodbye until next time thank you for
56:10
listening to stem talk we want this
56:12
podcast to be discovered by others so
56:14
please take a minute to go to iTunes to

rate the podcast and perhaps even write
56:19
a review more information about this and
56:21
