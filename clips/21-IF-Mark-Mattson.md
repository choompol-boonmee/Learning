Thanks, Brian.
00:20
I am at the National Institute on Aging, and as many of you know--
00:25
people are getting older, and there have been
00:27
advances in cancer research, cardiovascular disease research--
00:32
many people who would have died in their 50s and 60s from those diseases
00:38
are living into the danger zone for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
00:43
It's projected that by 2050, the number of people
00:46
with Alzheimer's disease will triple from what it is today.
00:50
It's 5 million today, it'll be 15 million by 2050.
00:55
In my lab, we use a number of different animal models
00:58
that are relevant to age-related neurodegenerative disorders.
01:02
We have mice that accumulate amyloid in their brain as they get older,
01:06
and they have learning and memory problems.
01:09
We have mice that have damage to dopamine producing neurons,
01:13
that control body movements-- that's Mylo-Parkinson's disease.
01:18
And we also have models of stroke, which is again another major-rate problem
01:23
and cause of death.
01:26
Well, it has been known for a long time that one way to extend
01:29
01:34
And, in rats and mice one can increase their life span by 30 or 40%.
01:40
We started looking at the effects of energy restriction on the brain
01:45
in the context of age-related neurodegenerative disorders,
01:49
and found that we could slow down, for example,
01:53
the abnormal accumulation of amyloid, or the degeneration of dopamine neurons
01:58
in the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's myel by reducing energy intake.
02:03
Now, there's a number of ways you can reduce energy intake.
02:06
You can simply eat less at each meal,
02:09
or you can do what we call intermittent fasting.
02:14
So, reduce the frequency of the meals.
02:17
And, what I am going to tell you today
02:19
is that fasting does good things for the brain.
02:23
In the animals we have insight into a lot of the neurochemical changes
02:28
that are occurring in the brain that we think explain
02:31
why fasting is good for the brain.
02:34
But I am going to start out
02:36
and talk a little bit about anecdotal evidence
02:39
that fasting is good for the brain,
02:42
and also evolutionary prospective
02:45
on why fasting might be good for the brain.
02:50
OK. So everybody knows that in certain religions
02:53
people will fast periodically.
02:56
Down through history
02:58
many famous people with good brains
03:05
have fasted regularly.
03:07
Up on the top here is a quote from Plato,
03:11
he fasted for greater physical and mental efficiency.
03:15
There are some quotes there,
03:18
including one from about 6,000 years ago,
03:23
an Egyptian pyramid inscription that says,
03:25
"Humans live on one-quarter of what they eat;
03:29
on the other three-quarters live their doctors."
03:32
And in this country, as you know, being overweight is a big problem.
03:37
It's not only a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes,
03:41
certain cancers, but emerging evidence suggests
03:45
that it's also a risk factor for age-related cognitive impairment,
03:49
and possibly Alzheimer's disease.
03:52
In the lower right, there is a reference to a book
03:55
written over a hundred years ago by Upton Sinclair.
03:58
Many of you may know Upton Sinclair is the author of "The Jungle",
04:02
a book on meatpacking industry, but he also wrote and published the book
04:07
that you can find in the full text online, it's called "The Fasting Cure".
04:11
In that book he interviewes 250 people who had some ailment
04:16
and went on fast for various lengths of time,
04:20
and except in a handful of cases,
04:23
their health condition improved.
04:29
OK, before I focus on the brain, which will be the main part of my talk,
04:33
I just want to point out
04:35
that there is evidence not just from animals,
04:37
but from humans that fasting is good for the body.
04:40
It will reduce inflammation,
04:43
it will reduce oxidative stress in organ systems throughout the body,
04:47
and one thing that happens when you fast, that does not happen
04:51
when you eat three meals a day, is that your energy metabolism shifts
04:56
so that you start burning fats.
04:59
Every time you eat a meal the energy goes into your liver
05:02
and it's stored in the form of glycogen--
05:11
and it's always tapped into first.
05:15
And it takes about 10 to 12 hours before you deplete the glycogen stores
05:19
in your liver.
05:22
So, if you eat three meals a day you never deplete the glycogen stores
05:25
in your liver, although if you exercise you can.
05:31
And once you deplete the glycogen stores in your liver
05:33
then you start burning fats,
05:35
and you produce what are called ketone bodies.
05:39
It turns out ketone bodies are very good for your brain,
05:42
and I'll talk about that in a minute.
05:47
Now, we've done a lot of work on animals
05:49
in the 90s, between 15 and 20 years ago,
05:54
showing that intermittent fasting was good for the brain,
05:58
then we started collaborating with some investigators,
06:00
did some human studies looking at effects on the body,
06:03
some that were shown on the last slide.
06:06
And then a producer at the BBC named Michael Mosley
06:11
made a program on intermittent fasting that was aired on the BBC,
06:16
it's been aired on PBS.
06:17
He wrote a book called "The Fast Diet".
06:20
And just in the last two years there's been a flurry of books
06:23
on intermittent fasting for health,
06:25
and it's becoming what, I think-- some people may think it's a fad,
06:30
but hopefully people find some of these--
06:37
What do I mean by intermittent fasting, and intermittent energy restriction?
06:40
There's a lot of variations, that there've been on used on this.
06:43
One sort-- a harsh one is every other day only eat 500 calories.
06:48
And in our human studies we've been doing what's called the 5:2 diet,
06:51
where 2 days a week you only eat 500 calories,
06:54
the other 5 days you eat normally.
06:56
Eat healthy if you can.
07:00
In this book called "The 8-Hour Diet" there's evidence that if you restrict
07:05
the time window that you eat each day to 8 hours or less,
07:10
it'll have health benefits,
07:12
again, that's long enough to shift the energy metabolism.
07:17
OK, why does fasting bolster brain power?
07:23
During development of your brain, but also in the adult,
07:26
neurons are generated from stem cells.
07:29
They grow out their axons and dendrites, they form connections with each other,
07:33
synapses, and communicate with each other.
07:37
During aging, many people-- their brain ages successfully,
07:41
they stay cognitively intact,
07:43
whereas, unfortunately, others develop diseases.
07:46
We think the reason, the main take-home message of this talk,
07:50
is fasting is a challenge to your brain,
07:54
and your brain responds to that challenge
07:57
of not having food by activating adaptive stress response pathways
08:02
that help your brain cope with stress, and resist disease.
08:10
Does this make sense in evolutionary terms?
08:12
Anything we talk about in biology, we always have to ask the question,
08:16
"Why is it that way?
08:18
Why when we take animals and put them on an intermittent fasting diet,
08:23
are their neurons protected, in mice, of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease?
08:27
Why do they perform better when we test their learning and memory?"
08:31
It amazes.
08:33
Well, if you're hungry and haven't found food,
08:38
you better figure out how to find food.
08:40
You don't want your brain to shut down if you're hungry.
08:44
And, in fact, that's what we find in the animals:
08:47
Nerve cell circuits are more active.
08:50
Some of the changes in the brain that occur with intermittent fasting
08:53
also occur with vigorous exercise.
08:56
Now, most people, and Jeff this morning gave a nice talk
09:00
on showing the benefits of exercise on him.
09:04
I think you probably found that it benefited your brain too? OK.
09:10
So, when we start looking at
09:12
what are the neurochemical changes in the brain with intermittent fasting.
09:15
They are very similar to exercise.
09:17
Now on this slide, in the upper left picture,
09:20
the third boy on the right running, that's my son, he is in the audience.
09:26
You can tell by the faces of the 3 kids-- they are in a cross-country race,
09:32
that's a challenge, right?
09:35
They are probably saying to themselves during the race--
09:38
I used to run races myself, I still occasionally do--
09:41
"Why am I doing this?"
09:44
However, when they get done with the race, they feel great, and they feel relaxed.
09:50
During the cross-country season my wife and I--
09:54
It's very obvious our son's mood was better.
09:57
On the right, my daughter is in the white.
10:00
Her mood was better during cross-country season.
10:03
Why is that?
10:05
Exercise and intermittent fasting both increase the production of proteins
10:09
in the brain that are called neurotrophic factors.
10:12
We discovered this many years ago, back when I was a postdoc
10:16
in Colorado in 1980s.
10:18
We found that these neurotrophic factors, such as FGF, and one called BDNF,
10:23
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, promote the growth of neurons,
10:27
promote the connection of neurons, and the strengthening in synapses.
10:32
OK, so here is the idea:
10:33
Challenges to you brain, whether it's intermittent fasting,
10:37
vigorous exercise, or what we are doing now,
10:41
hopefully if you haven't fallen asleep, is cognitive challenges.
10:46
When this happens, neurocircuits are activated,
10:48
levels of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF increase.
10:52
That promotes the growth of the neurons,
10:54
the formation and strengthening of synapses.
10:56
Also shown in the lower left, it turns out both,
10:59
exercise and intermittent fasting, and using your neurons, using your brain
11:05
can increase the production of new nerve cells from stem cells,
11:08
at least in one region of your brain, called the hippocampus,
11:12
which is shown here.
11:13
I mentioned ketones, which come from burning fat,
11:17
and that happens during fasting.
11:19
The Romans discovered ketones even though they had no idea,
11:23
they haven't taken any chemistry course, or didn't know what it was.
11:29
People with epileptic seizures back then,
11:32
they thought they were possessed by demons.
11:34
And they found if they take these people and shut them in a room,
11:38
and don't feed them, the demons will go away.
11:42
What's happening is:
11:44
ketones go up, and it's well known that ketons suppress seizures,
11:48
and in fact, ketogenic diets are used to treat, even today,
11:52
patients with severe epilepsy.
11:56
We are doing my work in my lab
11:58
trying to understand why ketones are good for neurons.
12:00
One reason is they provide an alternative fuel for the neurons,
12:04
they boost the energy levels in the neurons.
12:07
Recently we discovered that fasting,
12:11
by increasing BDNF levels in the brain, as a neurotrophic factor,
12:16
can increase the number of mitochondria
12:20
in your nerve cells.
12:22
And I am not going to go into details of this slide,
12:24
but the mechanism is very similar to the mechanism
12:28
where by exercising your muscles increases the number of mitochondria
12:32
in your muscles.
12:33
The fasting is a mild energetic stress, and the neurons respond adaptively
12:39
by increasing mitochondria, which helps them produce more energy,
12:43
and in this paper cited down here, "Nature Communications",
12:47
we recently showed that
12:51
by increasing the number of mitochondria in neurons,
12:54
it can increase the ability of the neurons to form and maintain synapses,
12:58
and thereby increase learning and memory ability.
13:05
In addition to the increasing neurotrophic factors
13:08
and increasing neuronal bioenergetics,
13:13
we've found that intermittent fasting
13:15
will enhance the ability of your nerve cells to repair DNA,
13:19
so right now-- and also probably exercise,
13:26
and also intellectual challenges.
13:29
And again, what's happening in this case when you are using your neurons,
13:33
exercising your neurons,
13:36
it causes a mild oxidative stress,
13:39
and at the same time that there is increased oxidative stress
13:42
the cells are enhancing their ability to repair oxidative damage to DNA.
13:50
Why is it that the normal diet is three meals a day plus snacks?
13:58
It isn't that it's the healthiest way, eating pattern,
14:02
and that's my opinion, but I think there's a lot of evidence to support that.
14:07
There are a lot of pressures to have that eating pattern.
14:11
There's a lot of money involved.
14:14
The food industry, are they going to make money
14:17
from skipping breakfast like I did today?
14:22
No, they are going to lose money.
14:24
If people fast the food industry loses money.
14:29
What about the pharmaceutical industries?
14:32
What if people do some intermittent fasting,
14:37
and exercise periodically, and they are very healthy?
14:40
Is the pharmaceutical industry going to make any money on healthy people?
14:44
So, one challenge for a society,
14:47
and this is one of the purposes of these TED Talks, hopefully,
14:50
is that communication is the way to improve health.
14:57
People understanding what they can do to improve their health
15:00
and then taking action, like Jeff talked about
15:04
15:07
So, I would urge you to communicate, and spread the word
15:12
that there are ways for people to be healthy,
15:16
and maybe we can do this even with--
15:21
Of course, I am working for NIH, and one thing about NIH is
15:25
we are using your tax payer's money to try to help your health.
15:29
We don't have a profit motive.
15:32
So, really one of the main reasons I've got interested
15:35
in things like intermittent fasting, exercise,
15:37
trying to understand at the cellular molecular level,
15:40
what's happening in the brain.
15:42
This is research that isn't commonly done,
15:45
and it's not done at all by pharmaceutical industries,
15:48
and it's not done so much.
15:51
So, I am going to end with this slide.
15:54
And thank you very much for your attention.
15:58
And try it out, you can just play around with these kinds of diets,
16:03
and you may find...
16:04
What we found in our human studies though is it's kind of like exercise:
16:08
if you've never exercised before, and you go and run 3 miles,
16:11
you are not going to feel good.
16:13
If you eat 3 meals a day,
16:14
and all of a sudden you go all day not eating anything
16:18
that day you are going to feel irritable, and ornery, and so on.
16:21
But it turns out if you can kind of force yourself to do that,
16:24
maybe one day a week for a month, and then two days a week,
16:29
you get used to it, and after a month or two
16:32
many people can adapt to that kind of diet with no problem
16:36
and you'll find that on the days when you don't eat so much
16:39
you are more productive. Thank you.
