Joseph Tainter on The Dynamics of the Collapse of Human Civilization

okay
so since you're the expert i'm just
going to jump right in
on stuff you know well um so can you
tell us and this is
again a film for the everyday person
so as simply as you can can you tell us
what makes civilizations run
properly and what are the components of
a healthy civilization
we can what are the components of a
healthy civilization
and what makes a civilization run
properly
we can think of a civilization as the
cultural tradition
of large complex societies we think of
civilizations
in such terms as traditions of art and
architecture and literature
traditions of government manners of
speech how people relate to each other
but what underlies all of these are the
institutions of complex societies
uh institutions of government
institutions of business
informal organizations in which we all
participate
and these institutions in in
civilizations tend to be quite complex
what i mean by complex is that they
consist of a large number of different
parts
and the parts are integrated to make a
whole so that the whole
functions as a coherent entity
rather than the parts functioning
individually an example would be a
business firm where there are
departments of finance production
innovation marketing
sales personnel and so forth that all
can cohere together
to make a functional whole that make a
system a complex system
complex institutions exist to achieve
things they exist to solve
problems and yet the problem with
complexity the challenge of complexity
is that it always costs
we can think of complexity in our own
lives and the cost that it imposes on us
living in our own complex society
the costs include such things as paying
taxes
filling out forms standing in lines
answering email mastering all of the
technologies
that we each have to master and just the
overall congestion of our lives
increase in complexity in a society or
in any smaller institution
always increases costs and so
if we talk about a healthy society or a
healthy civilization we have to think of
it in terms of a balance of benefits to
costs
and that balance is never static that
balance changes over time
so if you look historically at how
civilizations evolve very often that
balance of benefits to costs tends to
deteriorate
and when it deteriorates uh beyond a
certain point this is when societies
start to be in trouble
is it possible for civilizations to go
away to fall
and what causes that collapse
is it possible for civilizations to go
away to fall
in what can cause a collapse if we think
of civilizations as cultural traditions
some parts are always changing some
parts
remain static for long periods of time
different civilizations sometimes
exchange
elements and behaviors between each
other so it's really more interesting to
talk about
complexity going away if
if a civilization is dependent on
complex institutions
then a collapse is a simplification it's
the loss of a level of complexity
and this does happen historically i can
think of about
two dozen cases one of the most common
trends in human history has been over
the last 12 000 years
a seemingly inexorable increase in the
complexity of human societies and human
institutions
and yet this trend is periodically
punctuated by instances of collapse
where societies simplify over a fairly
short period of time
often this is accompanied by great loss
of life
the great traditions of art and
architecture and literature are often
lost so that subsequently there may be
centuries of what are called dark ages
can you give us examples of
ones that people may know of yeah there
are many examples of
civilizations or complex societies
collapsing perhaps
the best known example is the western
roman empire
which collapsed during the course of the
5th century a.d
and plunged europe subsequently into
what became known as
the dark ages and then there are others
as well there's
maya civilization of what's now
guatemala the central part of guatemala
the lowlands
which developed over several centuries
the people built
great pyramids and cities earthworks and
waterworks
this area supported a very high density
of people and yet within a century it
all went away
their civilization had not only
collapsed it largely disappeared
there are other examples as well um
in ancient greece long before the period
of classical greece
uh during the bronze age in the late
1200s 1100s bc there was a civilization
known as the mycenaeans
mycenaean civilization persisted for
several centuries and then it too
collapsed
in what's today iraq what historians
refer to as mesopotamia
there were at least two collapses
one is known as the the third dynasty of
ur which collapsed
late in the second millennium bc and
later on in the late first millennium
a.d
another civilization an islamic
civilization called the abbasid
caliphate collapsed
and the results of these collapses were
so devastating that there are parts of
iraq that are still uninhabitable
uh because to support their complex
societies
they had to intensively cultivate the
land through irrigation
and the result of this was that they
terribly salinized
their agricultural fields and ultimately
agricultural production declined
their energy bases went away and the
civilizations couldn't be maintained
and there are parts of iraq to this day
that are still devastated by these
events that happened centuries and even
millennia before
i remember from your book you were
counting the ick
yes do you mind from the camera just
telling for everyone
how bad it can get the disintegration of
what we know is normal
as a human life perhaps an extreme
example
of collapse is an african people known
as the ick
who were studied by an anthropologist in
the 1960s
the ick represent almost the extreme of
collapse or complete loss
of what we consider human society and
human sociability and interdependence
in the the icar and atomized society
each individual
has to fend for him or herself
there are almost no social institutions
left
children are born but at about the age
of three they are put out to fend for
themselves
and those that survive do manage to fend
for themselves
individuals will not assist each other
they won't help each other they don't
cooperate
ick society has become atomized down to
the level of the individual so that
there's no cooperation
there's no sociability people don't help
each other
and so this the society as we would
consider society
really has disappeared it no longer
exists and people suffer greatly because
of this
i want to talk about the loss of
complexity a little bit
and just to help us understand what that
means
when you go from a complex structure to
a simple structure
what are you what about that structure
you lose and it makes it go too simple
when a society collapses and becomes
simpler what are some of the things that
are lost
well to bring this home to our lives
consider the potential future collapse
of our own civilization if it were ever
to happen we hope that it doesn't
but it's possible that it could consider
what would be lost simply in terms
of our access to health care throughout
most of human history
the average life expectancy has only
been about 48 to 50 years
and by the time one was in one's 40s one
would be old
we have overcome these limits today
through industrialized
complex medicine that's supported by the
energy basis of our society by fossil
fuels
think of the consequences if we were to
lose this this complex institution
something that we consider simple today
like appendicitis would once again
become a gruesome way to die and many
people would die from it
our life expectancy would decline
tremendously which is something that one
sees going on in russia
today with the demise of the soviet
union
other institutions also simplify in a
collapse generally
the government becomes much simpler if
there's any government left at all
the scale of territories that are
incorporated into a single society
often shrink knowledge of
distant places and distant people goes
away
many specialties go away producers of
art and literature for example suddenly
find that there are no more markets for
their work
and so we find that there are then dark
ages these are some of the consequences
of a collapse but perhaps the most
devastating of all is that collapses
usually involve a great loss of
population
in the case of the maya civilization of
the lowlands
at one time there were millions of
people living there and it was in fact
one of the most densely
populated areas of the pre-industrial
world
but within a century approximately 90
percent of those
people left or died the population
declined by as much as 90 percent
how would you describe our current
civilization as an american civilization
at western civilization
who's a part of that civilization who
isn't is it global
how would i describe our current
american civilization
is it a western civilization is it
global
civilizations as i say are cultural
traditions
and today there's a great deal of
sharing in cultural traditions
i think it's perhaps more meaningful to
talk
about the industrial way of life
the industrial way of life is something
um that has been achieved in in a select
group of nations
and we can think of the world today as
perhaps divided into three groups
there are those who were members of this
group to varying degrees
there are others other nations who would
like to be part of it who would like to
become part of the wealthy industrial
world
and then there's an outside group who
seem to actively reject it
often these people who rejected are
cultural or religious conservatives in
traditional societies
who believe that the influence of
westernism and industrialism is
corrupting to their societies
and there's there's great conflict uh
that arises from
uh this division of the world between
those who have
those who want to have and those who
reject
is if this is would you say that the
industrial civilization is global and
does it
impact does that increase its complexity
and thus its survivability
is the industrial civilization global
and does that affect complexity and
survivability
the answer is definitely yes and it
affects in particular the survivability
of local communities
i did a study recently in which i was
surprised to find
two remote areas of the world utterly
unconnected to each
other that in recent years have gone
down very similar paths one area was my
the northern part of my home state of
new mexico
and the other area is appears a remote
region mountainous region in the
northwest part
of greece i was surprised to find when i
read about appearance
that this remote area went down a path
that was very similar to what i've seen
happen in northern new mexico
local communities lose autonomy
they lose their independence communities
break up
people stop practicing their traditional
subsistence
they stop maintaining their environment
and so the environment deteriorates uh
in both of these areas
the forests have grown overly dense with
woody plants that are prone to fire
and yet at the same time there's a great
increase in erosion
and i wondered how is it that these
unrelated places
have managed to go down these parallel
paths
well the reason is globalization what
has happened with globalization
is that localities and local people
in their communities are affected by
distant forces that largely they're
unaware of
by distant economic and political forces
that they may never hear about
so it's almost as if these sudden these
new problems that they confront fall out
of the sky they don't understand where
these problems come from
i've talked about this at a lot of
meetings and every time i talk about it
someone comes up to me and says yes
that's just like the people i study
and i think this is a global problem
with globalization
that as as material goods flow
and as the economy broadens and as the
globe becomes more integrated
the flow of information has not kept up
so the people in local communities still
live a local life
a life of local information rather than
understanding the broader processes that
are affecting them
because we are all becoming
interdependent on
these material flows does doesn't make
us more vulnerable
to a collapse because it's it it's that
much harder because it is an
international system
because we're now largely globalized we
have a global economy
raw materials manufactured goods and
money flow around the world
does this somehow make us more
vulnerable i think that it does
as places lose self-sufficiency
as a as a nation such as the united
states for example no longer
manufactures very much in the way of
textiles what were to happen
if our supply of textiles from the far
east for example were to be disrupted
for whatever reason and we can think of
this problem of disruption of supply of
the things that we depend on is being
possibly one of the consequences of
globalization
globalization depends on a fleet of
ships out on the sea
trying to meet deadlines trying to be in
in their ports on time trying to be in
their ports on time
and this flow of goods really depends on
these tight
timetables it depends on having adequate
energy adequately priced energy
and any disruption suddenly leaves
a nation unable to import some of the
goods on which it suddenly relies but
may no longer produce
what energy does our civilization depend
on and do we have enough of it
what civilization does our energy depend
on and do we have enough of it
well of course we rely primarily on
fossil fuels particularly petroleum also
coal and natural gas and because we rely
on these
everything we do is subsidized i can
offer a personal anecdote
of how these subsidies work my wife and
i recently went shopping
for some furniture in an ikea store it
was the first time i'd been in one of
those and
i was pleasantly surprised to see the
low prices
pleasantly surprised to get to the
checkout stand and find how low the
total bill was
and i wondered how they were able to
offer nice furniture at such a low price
and then i realized that the price was
subsidized by centuries of
photosynthesis
and forest nutrients that subsidize the
growing of the forests that are being
harvested to produce the furniture
in the same way on a larger scale all of
us are subsidized in our lives
by fossil fuels fossil fuels
underlie everything that we do and
because of fossil fuels
we don't really pay the full price of
anything that we consume
to a certain extent to a very large
extent much of the price was paid
millennia ago
when fossil fuels were being formed so
our civilization depends on fossil fuels
our economy depends on them our way of
life
nearly everything that we do on a daily
basis is subsidized by fossil fuels
as we've all experienced recently the
price of fossil fuels is increasing and
it's increasing quite rapidly
does this mean that we are soon going to
run out of fossil fuels
probably not but it's worthwhile
to investigate whether we're at a
transition point now
where fossil fuels are going to continue
to become scarcer
and to grow more expensive and we have
to ask ourselves if that is the case
what will be the consequences for our
civilization for our way of life
for our ability to address our problems
what are
the substitutes are there substitutes
for
since it if we are in transition what
are we transitioning to
do we have time to transition to a
technology that would fill the place of
oil
what are the substitutes for fossil
fuels what might we rely upon
in the future one possibility is nuclear
but it has never fulfilled its potential
and it's not clear that it ever will
there are grave concerns about nuclear
fuels
nuclear fusion technology has has not
progressed to the point where it's
usable or economical
and again it's not clear that it ever
will so the alternatives
appear to be renewables
many people favor renewables and there
are very good reasons for favoring them
but using renewables would also have
consequences
one of the characteristics of fossil
fuels is that they tend to be very high
in quality
which is to say that they have many
calories of potential heating value
packed into a fairly small compact
package
renewable fuels are not the same solar
energy is diffuse
very little of it falls on any given
square meter of land surface
what that means is this is that if we
have a future dependent
on let's say solar energy whether it's
solar energy directly
our solar energy driving wind
to achieve the same level of energy
consumption that we have today is going
to require
a much larger land area than we
currently allocate
to energy now we think our current way
of energy use is very destructive
of the environment but it's sobering to
realize that a future based on renewable
energy sources may actually
take in more of the environment than we
currently use now
possibilities including recreating
coastlines to capture wave energy
we've already done this to a certain
extent by damning many rivers
um creating lakes that extend for tens
of kilometers sometimes as much as 100
kilometers or more
and we've destroyed habitats with this
we've disrupted species
and we've lost much natural beauty by
building hydroelectric dams
this i'm afraid is part of the future
that we may face
that we are going to have to make
choices even more severe choices than we
make now
about how much land area and how much
environmental destruction we're willing
to tolerate to produce the energy that
we need
on the other hand i think there are
positive aspects to a future based on
renewables particularly
if the production of renewable energy is
not centralized
let's envision a future in which
renewable energy is produced
by individual households perhaps
dispersed over the landscape
individual households producing solar or
wind energy for their own use
so that the individuals in those
households become cognizant of energy
they're aware of where it comes from and
how much of it they use
they can decide how much to use they can
come up with ways of conserving it
they can figure out the best use of it
and the best
ratio of benefits to costs so the
problem with the future is
that there's no free lunch we have
decisions to make about
what kind of future we want and there
are pluses and minuses
to any path that we take so in your
opinion what is the state of our
civilization now in terms of our
complexity and the energy
that we're using to maintain the
complexity do you
do you think about this about where
we're headed and if we're in transition
what is the state of our civilization
now in terms of
the energy that we use its complexity
whether we're heading for a transition
and what is our direction
we are clearly the most complex
civilization that's existed on earth
with the most complex institutions of
problem solving
and those institutions are also quite
effective
through industrial production methods
and with the use of energy we have
solved
many of the problems that plagued
humanity for all of its existence
we've greatly reduced problems of hunger
people
owned enough clothes there was a time in
our fairly recent past when most people
would own one pair of clothing
today we can't imagine owning only one
set of clothes
people have access to health care they
have education
and so we've accomplished great things
through our approaches to problem
solving
but this all depends on having the
resources to continue it
it all depends on having sources of
energy that are abundant
and affordable and it appears that
sometime within the next century we will
probably be going through a transition
out of our dependence on fossil fuels
and into a new era
in which we may be relying on renewable
sources of energy
do i think that the transition will be
graceful
or is there a potential for a dark age
i'm not sure that i know and i think
there is potential for a dark age
one of the problems that i see is that
so many
people who have to individually accept
the cost of the transition are unaware
that it's coming
most of our citizens wake up in the
morning and
worry about the morning commute and
getting the kids to school
and paying the mortgage and thinking
about a new car or a vacation or
whatever
and this is simply too narrow a scale of
thinking to address the problems that we
have
we need people to be aware of the global
forces that affect their lives and that
will increasingly affect their lives in
the future
if this awareness doesn't develop then
i'm afraid the transition will probably
be wrenching
and by wrenching what do you mean
i'm afraid if this awareness doesn't
develop
then i'm afraid that the transition will
probably be abrupt
difficult and painful for many of us yes
some people believe that our
civilization has arrived at a bottleneck
you know wilson talks about that in
which the carrying capacity of the
biosphere is in such a place that
humanity
we will have to radically change our
ways
or stand to lose billions of people now
i know a lot of what you talk about
is as the cause for collapse
do you thought think at all about what
it means to overshoot your resources
as a source of collapse and in terms of
the bottleneck do you see us
in currently in a bottleneck where we're
overshooting our resources
are we currently approaching a
bottleneck where we're going to
overshoot our resources and potentially
collapse
societies in the past collapsed when
they were unable to solve their problems
or when they couldn't afford to solve
their problems
a major challenge that i see for the
future is a convergence of problems
each of which alone is a very great
magnitude
and that together may be overwhelming
think in terms of all of the problems
that are going to converge the very
large problems that are going to
converge
in the next several decades global
warming for example
what are going to be the consequences
the costs of adjusting to global warming
how is the world going to absorb let us
say half the population of bangladesh if
so much of that nation is going to go
underwater
combine that with the looming problems
in industrial societies of funding
retirement pensions for the baby boomers
the people my age
the rising costs of health care the
costs of our military spending
the cost of rebuilding our
infrastructure what i'm afraid i see in
the future is a collision of all of
these things converging at once
and costing enormous amounts of money so
how are we going to adjust to this how
are we going to pay for it
how are we going to have the wealth to
solve the environmental problems
that that we have created through
through industrialism
it's possible that there will have to be
much higher taxes in the future
or in some other way our children and
our grandchildren are simply going to
have a lower standard of living
to pay for all of these problems that
are converging
it's possible also if one wants to be
hopeful
that as we transition to new energy
sources
that we may have bountiful new sources
of energy and that
the technology of producing these and
will
and that the technology of producing
these will produce a new
economic wave a new economic upturn
so that we generate the wealth to solve
the problems but we hope
one hopes that as we go through this
transition
that we develop a new awareness a new
consciousness
of how what we do now affects things
affects people in the next generation
and in the generation after that
just as things that happened centuries
ago affect us today
so in your opinion just to go back to
the perfect storm what are the forces
that are making up the bottleneck global
warming so could you restate them maybe
in a full
pointless what are the forces that are
making up the bottleneck
one can see a concatenation of
problems emerging global warming is just
one of the environmental problems that
we are facing
our loss of biodiversity our loss of
tropical forests
erosion loss of sources of clean water
all of these are problems that are going
to be costly to address
and in the future we're going to have to
choose whether to address them and
decide whether we can afford to
we add to these problems that affect
some individual nations particularly
industrial nations
these include such things as funding the
retirement pensions
of baby boomers such as myself
rising costs of health care rising costs
of military investment
increasing costs of repairing the
decaying infrastructure that we see all
about us
we're going to incur very high costs to
address these problems in the future and
i think we are going to have to
decide whether we can address all of
them or whether we may simply decide not
to resolve some of them
i think there are some societies in the
past that were confronted with very high
costs for addressing their problems
and simply decided not to simply
realized that they could not afford to
address their problems
and accepted almost a voluntary collapse
instead
what do you think will get us through
the bottleneck or
what can we do to avoid a collapse is
something like this avoidable
and are there different kinds of
collapse
how will we get through this bottleneck
can we go down gently are there
different types of collapses
can we navigate our way through it can
the engineers come up with a solution to
get us through this
these are questions that time will tell
to a certain extent we can foresee what
the possibilities are
but we really don't know how things will
turn out what we can say is that
we are a species that tends to muddle
through we rarely plan long term
we tend to encounter problems and
develop short-term solutions to get us
through the immediate problem
without thinking out what are the
long-term consequences not only of the
problem but of our solution to the
problem
and sometimes those consequences can
ramify out for
decades or even centuries if we want to
do something more
than muddle through i believe we need to
expand
our educational system so that people
become
can be taught to be aware
of the converging problems and the fact
that these problems are distant and
long-term
and to be curious about the forces that
affect their lives
but that they don't see around them
every day i'd like to see our
educational institutions
emphasize teaching children to think
about
things that are distant in time and
space and how those things might affect
their lives
how do problems in indonesia affect the
lives of people in los angeles for
example
how does unrest in china affect our
foreign policy
and in turn how does unrest in china
affect
the availability of things that we
depend on in our
in our markets these are all the kinds
of things that children need to be
taught to be curious about
children also need to be taught to be
curious about long-term developments
because what happens today is a
reflection of things that have been
developing over very long periods over
historical time
generations even several centuries so
that we really can't understand our
predicament today unless we know how
that predicament has come about
so i'd like to see our educational
system expanded
so that children would learn to be
curious about things that are distant in
time
and distant in space and to understand
how all of those connect and influence
their own lives
and if we could develop that awareness
in a generation or two of systematic
education
then we might have a citizenry who are
truly involved in understanding
environmental issues
and issues of problem solving and
complexity and are committed to
and able to resolve them from an
environmental standpoint
what is the biggest problem you think we
are facing
from an environmental standpoint what is
the biggest problem that we are facing
i think the biggest problem is clearly
to develop
new sources of clean abundant and
affordable energy
energy is the key to everything else
that we do with abundant and affordable
and clean energy we can solve a lot of
other problems
without it we're not going to be able to
solve very many problems at all
i would also mention global warming
which is producing
a scale of changes that humanity has
never confronted before
we can't even begin to calculate what
it's going to cost
to adjust to address the problems that
are being generated by global change
but the first priority has to be energy
with abundant energy there's much that
we can accomplish
and what are we renewables again but
what energy
is there enough i've read in some other
authors to say that
um renewable energy just can't work it's
not enough and we can't generate enough
renewables really to replace
oil
they're just not it just is not an
equivalent
do you think about that and what gives
you the most what are you most excited
about in the clean abundant energy
section it's often suggested
that renewable energy sources cannot
replace oil
that they simply cannot produce the
level of energy that we're used to
consuming today
and on one level this is correct energy
produced from petroleum is very high in
quality
which is to say that it has many
calories per unit of measure
and so you can accomplish a lot of work
with it whereas solar energy or other
things that we derive from solar energy
such as wind energy
produce very little energy per unit of
surface area let's say per square meter
of land
and so we are going to be devoting a
large part of the earth's land surface
to producing energy
and this is simply a sacrifice that
we're going to have to make if we want
to continue to have
the level of energy that we're
accustomed to today
we can hope that as renewable energy
sources
begin to become established that there
will be technical improvements we're
almost certain there will be technical
improvements
that increase their efficiency and that
might allow us
perhaps to reduce the area of land that
has to be allocated to them
but if we want to continue our present
way of life
or something like our present way of
life we're probably going to have to
make the sacrifice of accepting
the allocation of large areas of land to
energy production
renewable energy production would you
advocate changing our lifestyle in order
to preserve
the environment scaling us down a little
bit
rather than continuing to deform the
planet for
sort of our you know consumer
based society
would i advocate changing our lifestyle
so that we have less of let's say an
ecological footprint so that we consume
less of the earth's resources
this is a moral question that i think
every individual has to decide
for themselves i think that to bring the
mass of
our citizens along in designing
solutions to the future they have to be
given
hope that they can continue a high
quality of life
a life that gives them opportunity and
fulfillment and health
inadequate food and housing i think
there's a possibility there are many
possibilities for technical improvements
to bring
this about but there may also need to be
a revolution in how we think
how we feel a moral revolution
one of the greatest challenges that we
face in this
in our country in regard to planning for
the future
is simply that our political system is
dysfunctional
there are too many politicians who
benefit personally
by frightening people about the future
by convincing people that they don't
really need to change
some of them maybe may actually some of
these politicians may actually believe
that we don't need to change but others
are simply cynical
they're simply doing it for their own
self-interest without regard for the
future
it's important that we have regard for
the future the future
is where our children will live what do
we owe future generations
what do we owe future generations i
believe we owe future generations
opportunity it's difficult to know what
the future will need
people 300 years ago could not possibly
have foreseen the way we live today and
they could not possibly have planned
what kind of earth to leave to us they
wouldn't know what kind of earth we
would need
and so similarly we can't envision
really what our descendants 100 years
from now will need
but what we can try to preserve is as
broad a range of opportunities as
possible and i think this will emerge
from again energy development
attempting to restore some of the
environmental damage
that industrialization has caused and
that overpopulation has caused
trying to find the many people
in the third world more productive ways
to live
so that they don't need to degrade their
farmland as extensively as they're
forced to now
these are the components of things that
we can leave for the future
yeah yeah yeah actually i'm working on
on overshoot now
um and you don't really think it
that's a core part of collapse it's more
complex well what i'm finding i'm doing
a literature synthesis now what i'm
finding is that there are actually not
very many collapses that seem to be
related to overshoot
they're related they're related to
inability to solve problems on a broader
level
but not so much related to um to
overshoot
there are one or two that maybe in fact
the mesopotamian ones are very clearly
what about overpopulation is the earth
overpopulated can we support more people
or would we
would be better off supporting less
clearly if there were fewer people on
earth
we would have less of an ecological
footprint we would be affecting the
earth's
resources the earth's ecosystems much
less than we do now
part of the political conflict in our
country
stems from the tendency of neoclassical
economics to think that things
to argue that things like population and
resources don't matter
conservative economists argue that
whenever there is scarcity as long as
there are incentives
something new will be invented to
resolve the scarcity so that population
and resources don't matter
and many of our politicians seize upon
the work of
neoclassical economists to forestall
finding solutions to our problems
they argue that the problems that many
of us foresee aren't actually problems
they will be resolved automatically by
market forces
this trusts our future to faith i would
prefer to trust our future to
rationality to plan for the future
to try to find ways out of the dilemmas
that we can see coming
part of the way out of the dilemma has
to be that there should be fewer humans
on earth
and we would like a reduction in human
population to come about
gently and voluntarily because the
alternative is too horrible to think
about
what do you think happened on easter
island
what happened on easter island where
a colony of perhaps 40 polynesians
landed in the middle of the first
millennium a.d
and found an island forested in great
palm trees and other species
and they were able to use these forests
to build ocean going canoes and fish
for deep water fish and sustain
themselves in this way
over time their population grew and it
appears that they were progressively
cutting down the forest
until finally the time came when there
was no forest left anymore
and then they were simply stuck on this
island their population had grown very
large
and yet they couldn't get off many
people consider this almost a microcosm
for planet earth
on a larger scale we can think of the
earth as as a great easter island where
we are consuming its resources and may
ultimately be stuck with a degraded
environment
that allows us no way out easter island
is a poignant
and interesting and intriguing case
i'm not convinced that we know yet what
happened
there i believe much more archaeological
research needs to be done in easter
island to find
out exactly why these forests were cut
down
one of the things that intrigues me
about easter island is
that the island was enmeshed in conflict
when europeans arrived conflict
drives consumption of resources without
any concern for the future
if you are in if you are engulfed in a
conflict if you're a nation
or a small tribe engulfed in a conflict
and your alternative
is to be defeated or to consume
resources
you're going to consume the resources
and let tomorrow take care of itself
and i think it's worth exploring whether
this conflict that developed on easter
island had anything to do
with the deforestation and the ultimate
loss of resources on the island
how long did just how long did they live
on the island after they cut down the
last tree oh well they're still there
the easter islanders are still there
[Music]
no no some of them the population got
down to some small number
80 90 people something like that and in
in the 1840s i think it was the
peruvians took a lot of them to the
mainland as slaves
peruvians are chileans i'm not sure
which but then those people came back
and and others remained on the island
the whole time but it may have had a
population of size 10 000 at one point
and by the 19th century it was down to
maybe 150 people or so
um so no they're still there and a lot
of them are trying to reconstruct their
traditions i mean culturally they're
very proud of what their ancestors did
did they not knock down the statues what
happened to the statues on easter island
were they deliberately torn down
when a dutch expedition came to easter
island in i believe the 1740s
they found that the statues were still
upright
when captain cook came to easter island
in the 1790s he found the people
timid thin hungry impoverished and many
statues had been pulled over
and by the middle of the 19th century i
believe almost all of the statues had
been pulled over
and this clearly reflects the conflict
that was underway within easter island
society
this conflict may have persisted for
centuries and it continued even into the
19th century even into the devastating
conditions in which people lived then
did they pull them down out of anger or
was it a
loss of belief in their gods or
ancestors
oh yes well as far as they knew they
were right yeah as far as they knew they
were the only people on earth
they're the most remote place in the
world and it is the most remote place
in the world we've ever developed
language in complete isolation
yeah yeah they developed their own
script in addition to the statues they
developed their own script
and i think it still can't really be
read
yeah but but as far as tearing down the
statues i suspect it is
simply an example of the kind of
destruction that happens in war
and you you pull down your enemies
accomplishments are there civilizations
that have undergone massive changes
let's say a voluntary simplification
unfortunately i know of only one but
that one is hopeful because it suggests
that it can be done
in the 7th century a.d the byzantine
empire was nearly overwhelmed
by the arabs who had newly converted to
islam
they were driven out of what's now the
holy land
judea and syria they were driven out of
egypt
they were driven back into what's now
the area of turkey
and at times they were even besieged
within their city of constantinople
which is now the city of istanbul
and it it looked like the byzantine
empire was going to fail that it would
be overcome by the arabs
the solution that they adopted was that
they gave up
their professional army which was very
expensive
and they settled soldiers on plots of
land
across the empire where they became a
peasant militia providing for their own
sustenance rather than having to be paid
by the government
when they did this the whole society
simplified
because the whole economy and society
were organized around amassing up the
resources
to pay for the army so once the army was
made to pay for itself
the government simplified literacy and
numeracy declined
the society simplified the aristocracy
simplified
and the whole society became much less
costly
what one finds across anatolia what's
now the land of turkey at this time
is that what had been great cities now
contract to fortified hilltops
and the peasant soldiers suddenly began
fighting better
because they were fighting for their own
land and they were fighting for their
own families so they had more incentive
to fight
so when they instituted this change
about
the 660s a.d all of a sudden the
byzantines started to rebound
they stopped losing land so quickly and
in another century they were on the
offensive and began reconquering lands
that they had previously lost
and within 200 years by about a thousand
a.d they had reconquered much of the
land that they had lost and they were
now the premier power
of europe in the near east and it's an
accomplishment that they won
by simplifying by reducing the
complexity and the costliness of their
problem-solving institutions
in energetic terms one of the things
that they did
was that they simplified their energy
flows one can think of this
in energy terms in energy terms
that the byzantine empire was a solar
energy based empire and the way it ran
was that solar energy would fall on
cultivated fields through photosynthesis
crops were produced
the crops were harvested peasants paid
taxes the taxes went to constantinople
the government took its share and then
sent the money back out to the provinces
to pay soldiers
all of a sudden all of those
intermediate steps are eliminated
which greatly eliminates the cost
because at each intermediate step
there's some loss
there's a cost to the transaction so now
solar energy falls on the land
photosynthesis takes place and the
peasant soldiers
harvest their crop and pay themselves
immediately and the government is much
less involved
it is a it was a simplification that
worked regrettably it's the only large
complex society i know of that
systematically and deliberately
simplified in this way
but it gives us some hope for the future
that it can be done ways can be found
i have one last question for our time
capsule
which is you know if you were gonna
somehow there was energy to play this
message in a hundred years
and the technology can be ready
people understand the language what
would you like them to know what would
you like to say to them
knowing what you what would i like to
say to people perhaps 100 years from now
well this will include some of my own
descendants i hope
as well as the descendants of all the
rest of us
i think you'll be going through a
transition i hope it will not be
an excessively difficult transition but
transitions are never easy
i hope you will live in a world in which
your educators take care
to make you curious about how things
connect to each other and affect your
lives
to make you want to know how things that
happen
on the other side of your country on the
other side of the world
connect to influence the way you live
and affect
whether your lives are positive or
negative
i hope that your educators will teach
you to think historically
to think long term about the processes
that take
generations up to centuries to develop
and yet affect your lives today
we're very concerned at this time about
the future many of us are
we're concerned about energy supplies
we're concerned about the state of the
environment
we're concerned about the complexity of
our societies and whether our societies
will continue to be effective in solving
problems
those are all processes that develop
beyond the lifetime of an individual
one needs historical knowledge to
understand these things
i hope that in the future humanity will
have this expanded scale of thinking
and if you do you'll be better
positioned to understand and solve
problems than we are today
