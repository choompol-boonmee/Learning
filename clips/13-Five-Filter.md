https://youtu.be/34LGPIXvU5M


00:04
'Propaganda'.
00:06
Many use the word when talking about countries
00:09
like North Korea, Kazakhstan, Iran.
00:18
Countries viewed as authoritarian through the lens of the western media.
00:26
'Press freedom'. 'Freedom of thought'.
00:29
People use those terms when talking about
00:32
countries like the United States, France, Australia.
00:37
'Democracies'.
00:40
In 1988, Noam Chomsky co-authored a book with
00:44
Edward Herman called 'Manufacturing Consent'.
00:49
It blasted apart the notion that media acts as a check on political power.
00:56
That media inform the public, serve the public
01:00
so that we can better engage in the political process.
01:05
In fact, media manufacture our consent.
01:09
They tell us what those in power need them to tell us ... so we can fall in line.
01:17
Democracy is staged with the help of media that work as propaganda machines.
01:25
Media operate through five filters.
01:29
The first has to do with ownership.
01:31
Mass media firms are big corporations.
01:35
Often, they are part of even bigger conglomerates.
01:39
Their end game?
01:40
Profit.
01:42
And so it's in their interests to push for whatever guarantees that profit.
01:47
Critical journalism takes second place to the needs and interests of the corporation.
02:00
The second filter exposes the real role of advertising.
02:06
Media costs a lot more than consumers will ever pay.
02:10
So who fills the gap?
02:13
Advertisers.
02:15
And what are the advertisers paying for?
02:18
Audiences.
02:20
And so it isn't so much that the media are selling you a product - their output.
02:26
They are also selling advertisers a product - YOU.
02:35
How does the establishment manage the media?
02:38
That's the third filter.
02:42
Journalism cannot be a check on power
02:44
because the very system encourages complicity.
02:51
Governments, corporations, big institutions know how to play the media game.
02:58
They know how to influence the news narrative.
03:01
They feed media scoops, official accounts, interviews with the 'experts'.
03:08
They make themselves crucial to the process of journalism.
03:11
So, those in power and those who report on them are in bed with each other.
03:18
If you want to challenge power, you'll be pushed to the margins.
03:22
Your name won't be down. You won't be getting in.
03:25
You've lost your access.
03:28
You've lost the story.
03:31
When the media - journalists, whistleblowers, sources - stray away from the consensus,
03:38
they get 'flak'.
03:39
That's the fourth filter. When the story is inconvenient for the powers
03:44
that be, you'll see the flak machine in action discrediting sources, trashing stories
03:52
and diverting the conversation.
03:57
To manufacture consent, you need an enemy - a target.
04:03
That common enemy is the fifth filter.
04:06
Communism.
04:07
Terrorists.
04:09
Immigrants.
04:10
A common enemy, a bogeyman to fear, helps corral public opinion.
04:18
Five filters.
04:19
One big media theory.
04:22
Consent is being manufactured all around you, all the time.
