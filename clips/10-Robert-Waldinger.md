https://youtu.be/aEgFI8j3b3A


we're here at TEDx Beacon Street and I'm
00:12
sitting down with dr. Robert Jay Wall
00:14
dinger he is the director of the Harvard
00:17
study of adult development at
00:18
Massachusetts General Hospital and a
00:20
clinical professor of psychiatry at
00:22
Harvard Medical School thanks so much
00:24
for taking the time so your talk is
00:27
called the good life I gotta know what
00:31
is the good life well the good life is
00:36
how the is what we discovered about the
00:39
people who did the best in life over 75
00:42
years and what we discovered was over
00:45
and over again that it was the people
00:47
who made good relationships their most
00:52
important goal who ended up being the
00:54
happiest but also the healthiest that
00:57
it's the the startling thing is that
00:59
being in the midst of warm close
01:01
relationships keeps people healthier all
01:03
the way through life and this is a study
01:06
that you guys did tell me a little bit
01:08
about this study it's probably the
01:10
longest study of adult life that's ever
01:13
been done yeah started in the late 1930s
01:15
with a group of Harvard undergrads and a
01:18
group of poor inner-city Boston boys and
01:21
we followed them all the way through
01:24
their teenage years and all the way into
01:27
old age over and over again getting
01:29
information about their work lives their
01:31
home lives their health
01:32
how many filing cabinets does this
01:35
research I just picture a warehouse 55
01:38
drawer filing cabinets 250 long file
01:43
drawers full of documents and you
01:46
managed to consolidate all that into a
01:49
15 minute TED talk which is pretty
01:51
impressive one of the big take-home
01:56
messages is in that TED talk yeah yeah
01:59
so tell me a little bit now without
02:02
giving you know too much away about the
02:04
talk but talk about the idea behind your
02:08
talk behind the study and why is it so
02:11
important why is this an idea worth
02:13
spreading
02:13
yeah well that the what we learn is that
02:18
people are constantly making life
02:20
choices what do I go after what's really
02:23
gonna be satisfying in my life what's
02:27
gonna make me happy what's gonna keep me
02:29
healthy and that those are really
02:33
meaningful choices and so what we're
02:36
doing is taking scientific data and
02:39
seeing okay what really does it for
02:41
people and and what we're finding for
02:43
example is that the big things we see in
02:46
the media wealth and fame and working
02:51
nonstop but those are the things that
02:54
get glorified in popular culture and
02:57
they turn out not to make people happy
03:00
yeah we're healthy they don't
03:01
necessarily make people unhappy they're
03:03
just not relevant what's really relevant
03:05
is how warm and closely connected they
03:09
feel to other people yeah and you know
03:11
it's it's interesting it's a message you
03:13
see in some like stories and stuff I
03:15
there's a better example I'm thinking of
03:17
like Ebenezer Scrooge not happy but
03:22
what's really cool is it's like well
03:24
it's not just a story there is data
03:25
right you know right extensive study of
03:28
that it showed this is true right so you
03:30
could either read a Christmas carol or
03:32
you could do our study for 75 years and
03:35
come out with basically the same
03:36
conclusion oh very good so the other
03:40
exciting thing is that your research in
03:42
this and this idea is it's not over yet
03:44
right this is an ongoing thing right we
03:48
are beginning to study the children of
03:51
the seven hundred and twenty-four men
03:53
who we've tracked for seventy-five years
03:54
children are all baby boomers in their
03:57
fifties and sixties over 2,000 of them
03:59
and we know so much about their
04:01
childhoods from their parents and now
04:04
we're gonna look at them in midlife and
04:05
see how childhood reaches across decades
04:09
to affect middle age very cool stuff
04:13
