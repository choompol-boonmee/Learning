Intermittent Fasting - How it Works? Animation

```
The goal is to systematically starve the body long enough to trigger fat burning.
00:15
While research is still underway and the method may not be suitable for everyone, there is
00:19
evidence that, when done correctly, intermittent fasting can help lose weight, lower blood
00:24
pressure and cholesterol, prevent or control diabetes, and improve brainâ€™s health.
00:31
During a meal, carbohydrates in food are broken down into glucose.
00:36
Glucose absorbs through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream and is transported to
00:40
various organs, where it serves as the major energy source.
00:45
Excess glucose is stored for later use in the liver and adipose tissue, in the form
00:50
of glycogen and fats.
00:52
In between meals, when the body is in the fasted state, the liver converts glycogen
00:57
back to glucose to keep supplying the body with energy.
01:01
Typically, an inactive person takes about 10 to 12 hours to use up the glycogen stores,
01:07
although someone who exercises may do so in much less time.
01:12
Once the reserve of glycogen in the liver is depleted, the body taps into energy stores
01:17
in adipose tissues.
01:19
This is when fats are broken down into free fatty acids which are then converted into
01:24
additional metabolic fuel in the liver.
01:26
Thus, if the fasted state lasts long enough, the body burns fat for energy and loses that
01:33
extra fat.
01:34
Losing the extra fat is translated into a range of associated health benefits.
01:40
Insulin is the hormone required for driving glucose into cells.
01:44
Insulin level is regulated to match the amount of glucose in the blood, that is, high after
01:49
a meal and low between meals.
01:52
Because insulin is secreted after each meal, eating throughout the day keeps insulin levels
01:57
high most of the time.
01:59
Constant high insulin levels may de-sensitize body tissues, causing insulin insensitivity
02:05
- the hallmark of prediabetes and diabetes type 2.
02:09
Fasting helps keep insulin levels low, reducing diabetes risks.
02:16
Fasting also has beneficial effect on the brain.
02:18
It challenges the brain the same way physical or cognitive exercise does.
02:23
It promotes production of neurotrophic factors, which support the growth and survival of neurons.
02:29
Fasting, however, is not for everyone.
02:33
Among those who should not attempt fasting are:
02:36
- children and teens - pregnant or breastfeeding women
02:39
- people with eating disorders, diabetes type 1, advanced diabetes, or some other medical
02:45
problems - people who are underweight or frail
02:50
Fasting can also be unsafe if overdone, or if not done correctly.
02:55
There are several approaches to intermittent fasting, but the easiest to achieve is perhaps
03:00
the one that simply extends the usual nighttime fast.
03:03
A daily cycle of 16-hour fast followed by a 8-hour eating window is usually sustainable.
03:10
For intermittent fasting to be safe and effective, it must be combined with balanced meals that
03:16
provide good nutrition.
03:17
It is important to stay hydrated, and know your physical limits while fasting.
03:23
The fast must be broken slowly.
03:25
Overeating after fast, especially of unhealthy foods, must be avoided.
