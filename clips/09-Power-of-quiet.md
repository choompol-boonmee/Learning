https://youtu.be/83siMGzd7e0


00:08
you're taking out time and energy in
00:10
your life to growth to learn to serve I
00:14
think it's an amazing commitment that
00:16
you make every single week and I just
00:18
want to take a moment to acknowledge
00:19
that I also want to say I'm so thankful
00:21
that you're sharing the insights on
00:24
Instagram on Twitter on Facebook trust
00:26
me I see them I try and share as many of
00:28
them as I can but I love seeing that
00:30
you're all gaining so many phenomenal
00:32
messages from my interviews with
00:34
incredible guests and the solo episodes
00:37
I do every single Friday and I also read
00:40
your reviews so your reviews means so
00:42
much to me I'm always scanning and
00:44
browsing through and noticing how much
00:46
love and kindness there is there so
00:49
thank you for allowing me to serve you
00:50
in this way and today I'm really excited
00:53
to introduce you to the gas today's
00:55
guest is someone that I've followed for
00:57
a very long time I've quoted his
00:59
research in multiple videos and in
01:02
multiple coaching sessions that I've
01:04
done when I saw his name on this list
01:06
where we currently are with the Arthur
01:08
Blank foundation in West Creek Ranch in
01:11
Montana when I saw his name I said I
01:14
have to have him on the podcast because
01:16
he's someone that I look up to so much
01:17
his TED talk is one of the top 10 most
01:20
viewed TED talks of all time which is
01:23
phenomenal in and of itself but he's
01:25
also a psychiatrist psychoanalyst and
01:28
Zen priest I can't wait to hear more
01:30
about that he's a professor of
01:32
psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School
01:34
and directs the Harvard study of adult
01:37
development one of the longest-running
01:38
studies of adult life ever done and
01:41
that's the one that I've quoted so many
01:43
times his name is dr. Robert ward inga
01:46
Robert thank you so much for doing this
01:48
it's a pleasure
01:49
yeah well very grateful to have you here
01:51
as I said I I mean every word I've
01:53
definitely quoted and referenced your
01:55
work so many times had to be sitting
01:57
here with you as an honor of mine and I
01:58
really appreciate it
02:00
but I wanted to start with the first
02:03
question about the study I just referred
02:05
to which you've dedicated so much of
02:07
your life and work to and I'd love you
02:09
to just introduce my audience to that
02:12
study just to set us up of where it
02:15
began and what it's really been
02:17
resembling sure so as you said as far as
02:20
we know it's the longest study of adult
02:23
life that's ever been done meaning we
02:25
started with a group of people in 1938
02:28
and we followed them through their
02:30
entire lives it started actually as two
02:35
separate studies a study of Harvard
02:39
College sophomores and a study of boys
02:43
from Boston's poorest neighborhoods as
02:48
far as the Harvard college boys a young
02:50
men are concerned they they were 268 of
02:54
them from the classes of 1939 to 1940 to
03:00
John Kennedy was a member of the study
03:02
Ben Bradley who was editor of The
03:05
Washington Post for so many years and
03:08
for example when the Watergate scandal
03:10
broke and then mostly ordinary people
03:14
who went to Harvard and then went on to
03:16
lead interesting but usually pretty
03:19
regular lives the inner city boys 456 of
03:26
them were selected because they were
03:29
from really disadvantaged families and
03:32
families with a lot of trouble and they
03:35
were selected with the question of why
03:38
are these boys able to stay out of
03:40
trouble why are they not able why do
03:43
they not get in trouble with the law and
03:45
become juvenile delinquent so it started
03:47
out as a study of who avoids juvenile
03:50
delinquency and why and then these two
03:54
groups of people were combined and
03:57
studied together starting in the 1970s
04:00
but initially they were separate studies
04:02
that didn't even know about each other
04:04
Wow so they actually started totally
04:06
separate so measuring something
04:08
completely different to what you ended
04:10
up finding and when did you get involved
04:12
in the process I got involved 50
04:14
years ago okay I'm the fourth director
04:16
and one of my heroes a professor of
04:20
psychiatry at Harvard was my predecessor
04:22
and he took me out to lunch one day and
04:25
said how would you like to inherit the
04:28
study of adult development and I was
04:31
dumbfounded and and at first said I
04:34
don't know anything about aging cuz the
04:36
men were pretty old by then and I study
04:40
couples and he said let's study ageing
04:43
couples so the first thing we did
04:44
together was to study late life marriage
04:48
and how it affects our health Wow and
04:50
that was how I joined the study oh
04:51
that's fascinating yeah oh that's
04:53
incredible I'd love to explore a bit on
04:55
your work with couples in research if
04:57
you don't mind as it's a slight tangent
04:59
tell me about some of the most
05:01
incredible things you've found from
05:02
studying marriage and how they affected
05:05
our well-being one of the things we
05:07
found which was the most surprising to
05:10
me was that arguing wasn't a problem in
05:15
couples we used to think that if you
05:18
argued a lot that it was a bad
05:20
relationship and it was gonna break up
05:22
turns out that wasn't true that many
05:28
couples could argue a lot and be really
05:31
tight and quite stable and other couples
05:34
didn't argue at all but gradually broke
05:37
up mm-hmm
05:38
when we videotape couples having a
05:41
disagreement the thing that clearly
05:44
predicted who was gonna stay together
05:45
five years down the road was how much
05:48
affection they showed for each other so
05:51
they could be arguing and really mad at
05:54
each other but as long as you saw that
05:56
bedrock of affection those were stable
05:58
couples and the couples that didn't have
06:01
much affection where the couples that
06:03
were in more trouble
06:05

a doubt sleep my close friend Arianna
07:32
Huffington wrote a great book all about
07:34
it and my sleep is so important listen
07:37
to these studies from Harvard and Johns
07:40
Hopkins chronic sleep deprivation has
07:42
been shown to lead to depression
07:43
diabetes obesity and cardiovascular
07:46
disease awareness is the first step to
07:50
better sleep now I'm sure you know we
07:53
need eight hours of sleep but have you
07:55
actually been getting that much there
07:58
have been many many times where I
08:00
haven't slept straight through the night
08:01
and it was because I was too hot
08:03
temperature is so important it plays
08:06
such a huge role in the quality of our
08:08
sleep
08:08

this makes it great for travel and also
09:25

my personal go-to is the coffee with
09:29
lion's mane now I've heard that lion's
09:31
mane mushrooms have been used by the
09:32
Buddhist monks to help with focus during
09:35
meditation and focus is something that
09:38
we all need in today's digital age and
09:40
guess what it's half the caffeine and
09:42
double the mental clarity I was worried
09:45
about the taste since its mushrooms but
09:47
it tastes just like coffee personally
09:49
mushroom coffee is way easier on my gut

10:14
forward slash purpose wow that's
10:17
incredible
10:17
yeah and I've seen that in other work as
10:19
well we're actually learning how to
10:22
fight it's such an important skill
10:25
exactly when actually our biggest desire
10:27
when it comes to arguments is thinking
10:29
we have to run away or worry something
10:31
or hide away we try to avoid conflict
10:34
and I think conflict resolution or
10:37
having tough conversations is such an
10:40
important skill that we never get
10:42
exposed to exactly in fact one of the
10:44
big developmental tasks of a young
10:47
couple is to learn how to handle
10:48
disagreements because every couple is
10:50
gonna have disagreements so how do we
10:52
handle them how do we get to a point
10:55
where one person doesn't win and the
10:57
other loses but that you get to a point
11:00
where you can emerge from a conflict
11:02
stronger and certainly no weaker and
11:05
what we found was that actually the
11:09
development of a couple relationship
11:11
goes through a stage of learning how to
11:14
resolve conflicts and then ideally you
11:17
no longer need to do that you've figured
11:19
that out and that as you get older the
11:22
developmental tasks for older couples is
11:24
learning how to support each other
11:25
because if you think about it as we get
11:28
older we really need each other more and
11:30
more like we need to lean on each other
11:32
physically as well as emotionally as
11:35
difficult things happen in our lives as
11:38
illness starts to happen so actually
11:41
when we started studying our older
11:43
couples we asked them to have an
11:45
argument on videotape they couldn't
11:47
think of things to argue about and we
11:49
thought what's wrong with this picture
11:51
and then we realized no no no it's
11:53
because they had already worked out how
11:56
they were gonna manage that's why they
11:58
lost it that's why they lasted and what
12:00
we found was that that the real real
12:03
interesting point for our older couples
12:05
was we when we asked them could you talk
12:08
about your biggest worry with your
12:11
partner and to see how the partner
12:13
supported them that was a huge window on
12:18
how the older couples were doing oh
12:20
that's some good what kind of things did
12:22
they say were their biggest worries is
12:24
that oh well sometimes really boring
12:28
things like I don't know what to make
12:30
you for dinner tonight honey and those
12:33
were not the interesting conversations
12:34
the interesting conversations were I'm
12:37
afraid that if I die first that you
12:41
won't be okay by yourself or I'm afraid
12:44
that if you die first I'll have to go to
12:47
a nursing home
12:48
or I'm afraid that when we die our
12:50
children won't handle their finances
12:53
well really big issues that then they
12:58
could talk about and often offer each
13:01
other mutual support around well and
13:03
that must have been a powerful question
13:06
for them to talk about because did you
13:07
find that at that stage of development
13:10
were they quite vulnerable with each
13:11
other or were they still these pockets
13:13
of not not hiding anything but just you
13:17
just don't think to talk about it you
13:19
feel scared of sharing it so you're
13:21
absolutely right in what you're
13:23
suggesting which is that couples varied
13:25
a lot like some couples could really be
13:28
open with each other and get right down
13:29
to basics and important issues and other
13:33
couples were pretty closed off or
13:36
sometimes one member of the couple could
13:39
be very emotionally available and the
13:41
other was pretty closed off mm-hmm so it
13:44
varied but the healthiest couples were
13:46
the ones who were really emotionally
13:48
there for each other yeah I've been
13:50
saying around the argument point al I've
13:52
been repeating in a lot of forums that
13:55
I've been in that when you're arguing
13:57
remember that it's not you against each
13:59
other it's both of you against the
14:00
problem absolutely because I've been
14:03
saying that I'm very competitive and I
14:04
like winning
14:05
I enjoy winning and I have learned in my
14:09
relationship with my wife that it's a
14:11
lot more fun to win together because in
14:13
a relationship if you win and your
14:16
partner loses you both lose exact and if
14:18
your partner wins and you lose you both
14:19
lose so the only way to win is to win
14:20
together exact how what have you seen
14:22
and I'd love to understand from you what
14:24
are those developmental steps that
14:26
people can take to actually argue better
14:29
or manage disagreements better great
14:33
question so there are actually some good
14:35
techniques and so we find that many
14:38
couples either go into couples therapy
14:41
or there are some good books that
14:42
couples can read that can help them and
14:44
there are strategies you can use so for
14:47
example what you said about realizing
14:49
that you're you're both trying to solve
14:53
a problem that it
14:55
not arguing with each other to see who
14:57
wins and who loses but how do we manage
14:59
this problem that once you make the
15:01
problem the enemy if you will yes you're
15:04
in much better shape there's some simple
15:07
language techniques so for example
15:09
making eye statements so instead of
15:13
saying when you said that you were
15:16
trying to make me mad or you hurt me
15:18
just we say you know when you said that
15:21
I felt hurt hmm and this is what it felt
15:26
like to me it felt like you meant this
15:29
hmm but then I'm not saying I know what
15:32
you were thinking I know what you were
15:33
trying to do I'm saying this is how I
15:36
received it and then I give you a chance
15:38
to tell me what you meant and then we
15:41
can do some repair and we can do some
15:44
getting to common ground so there are
15:46
there variety of techniques like that
15:48
that are pretty easy to learn and that
15:50
can really help change those awful
15:53
conversations to ones where you both end
15:55
up feeling closer yeah and I love that
15:58
switch that you're making from u2i
16:00
language because I think when we are
16:02
saying uuuuu we end up making these like
16:06
permanent statements based on a
16:09
temporary event and we start making
16:12
these big accusations rather than
16:15
articulating how we feel yes and we
16:18
express the anger rather than explain it
16:20
and and when people don't feel like
16:22
you're explaining something and we
16:26
expect the other person to read our mind
16:27
and just know what we've been thinking
16:28
about it becomes very hard and so much
16:31
gets lost in that eye field so I love
16:32
that switch right I think that's really
16:34
really powerful and practical for people
16:36
the other thing you just pointed out was
16:38
this tendency we have to say you always
16:41
do this yeah or you never do this and
16:44
you always and you never are terrible
16:48
statements because nobody always does
16:50
anything or it never does anything and
16:52
so if we can stay with what are we just
16:55
disagreeing about right now you didn't
16:59
take out the trash when I asked you to
17:01
let's just talk about that
17:03
not you never help around the house yeah
17:08
definitely I love that I hope you guys
17:10
are taking notes if you're listening or
17:11
watching right now those are three
17:13
really practical steps and tips that I'd
17:16
love for you to test out this week
17:17
experiment with you're naturally gonna
17:20
have an argument and just put it in
17:21
there just to start throwing these
17:22
things in because you start to see how
17:24
much they can benefit you and one of the
17:26
big things while we move forward from
17:28
this argument point that I've been
17:29
encouraging people is that you don't
17:31
prepare for an argument in the argument
17:34
so a lot of people say oh but Jay when
17:37
I'm when we're fighting like I can't
17:39
think of this stuff I can't remember and
17:41
I say exactly like the the sports player
17:44
or the athlete doesn't prepare on world
17:47
cup game day or the match today they're
17:49
preparing beforehand so what I say to
17:51
people is when your relationship is
17:52
feeling strong when you're having a good
17:55
time use that time to discuss how you'd
17:57
like to deal with disagreements because
18:00
that's this time when you're steady
18:01
that's the time when you're in the right
18:03
sense of mind and state of mind and you
18:06
can make decisions for look I know we
18:08
may argue about this and I'd love for us
18:10
to communicate in this way and if you
18:12
prepare for that beforehand you're more
18:13
likely to remember that that's just my
18:15
intuition and instinct on it but it's a
18:17
great intuition and to that point one of
18:21
the things people should feel free to do
18:22
is take a timeout yes
18:24
so as you say you know I can't think of
18:26
what I want to think of right now to say
18:28
and sometimes it's just going in a bad
18:30
direction and that's the time when you
18:33
should be able both of you to say look
18:35
let's take a timeout it's just not
18:37
feeling good right now let's let's come
18:40
back to this and then really come back
18:42
to it yes like one of the Maxim's that I
18:44
like sometimes is strike while the iron
18:47
is cold that when things are really hot
18:50
that's often when you say things you
18:52
regret when you can't think of the right
18:54
things or you can't say it as you mean
18:56
to and if you can take a timeout go away
18:59
that's okay how do I really want to
19:01
explain this then you come back and you
19:04
can you can say more of what you want to
19:06
say in the tone that you
19:07
say it in and and do more constructive
19:11
building of the relationship again yeah
19:14
that's beautiful I love that I'm really
19:15
glad we got to address that together and
19:17
now back to thee yes seventy-five years
19:18
study no I'm glad I'm really happy I'm
19:20
really happy we got to go in that
19:22
direction I think it's a really positive
19:24
and powerful conversation and very
19:25
practical but when we look at this 75
19:27
year study what were your biggest
19:31
fascinations when you got involved with
19:33
it and then tell us a bit about the
19:35
things that you found the surprising
19:36
things and the things that you think is
19:38
so important for us my friends
19:43
absolutely love cycling it's one of
19:45
their many joys in their life apart from
19:47
sports so they say there's no greater
19:50
rush than being part of a cycling class
19:52
but unfortunately they can't always make
19:55
one of those because it's not in their
19:56
time but with peloton they're able to
19:59
join a cycling class whenever they want
20:01
right where they're fully engaged and
20:03
always get a great workout with peloton
20:07
there are no excuses no busy schedules
20:10
no commutes or no rushing to get your
20:12
favourite bike they offer a wide variety
20:14
of classes instructors and music choices
20:17
so you never have a boring workout right
20:20
seeing my friends talk about this like
20:22
they're taking live studio classes right
20:25
from their living room pushes me to
20:27
think about working out in my world
20:29
living room as well so you can see
20:31
real-time metrics as you ride and track
20:34
your performance over time you can work
20:37
up a sweat with world-class instructors
20:39
who are biking right by your side which
20:42
is so motivating the motivation is
20:44
real-time and crazy effective imagine
20:47
that feeling you get right you seriously
20:49
can't go wrong the peloton bike has a 22
20:52
inch HD screen and keeps you fully
20:54
focused throughout your workout and the
20:57
bike is also near silent right you don't
21:00
even notice it which is which is amazing

caseta by Lutron smart switches learn
22:23
more about caseta at Lutron comm forward
22:26
slash purpose again that's Lutron comm
22:28
forward slash purpose go be smart my
22:31
fascination was in what happens to
22:35
people throughout their lives what
22:37
really happens to people not what do we
22:40
remember because we often tell ourselves
22:42
stories trying to remember back to what
22:44
happened in our lives and also not what
22:49
do we think ought to happen but what's
22:52
life really like for people there's so
22:54
much hype about what life is supposed to
22:56
be like right I mean look at look at
22:58
just look at advertisements yes and look
23:00
at social media and you would imagine
23:01
that everybody's happy and on vacation
23:04
and at parties all the time
23:05
but what's life really like and so
23:07
getting to look at that getting to
23:10
follow someone's life over 80 years is
23:12
such a privilege so I thought this is
23:15
like the most amazing work I could
23:17
possibly do so that's why I wanted to do
23:19
it and then some of the things we found
23:23
were things that were ex
23:26
back table but really important messages
23:28
to get out there so for example - we
23:31
find that smoking is really bad for your
23:35
health
23:35
mm-hm and your longevity and that that
23:38
tobacco kills okay that we are just one
23:42
more study to remind us of what we know
23:45
alcoholism is a terrible problem and so
23:48
people who get into trouble with
23:50
alcoholism really need help and support
23:52
in getting treatment for that drug abuse
23:55
as well um exercise regular exercise
23:59
really does keep people healthier and
24:02
allow them to live longer so again these
24:04
are not surprises but to say that
24:07
there's more and more science behind
24:08
this is helpful for some people hundred
24:10
percent yes and then that the surprise
24:13
for me and I think for many of us was
24:17
the finding that people who aged better
24:20
people who stayed healthier as they got
24:23
older people who lived longer were
24:26
people who had warmer closer
24:30
relationships and people who were more
24:32
socially connected to others that
24:35
initially when we started finding that
24:38
in our data we didn't believe it because
24:40
we said well wait how could like a bunch
24:43
of social relationships how could that
24:45
make you live longer mm-hmm
24:47
what happened was that other studies
24:50
other research groups began to find the
24:52
same thing and that helped us believe it
24:54
and now what we're studying is how does
24:58
that happen how could how could the
25:01
warmth of your relationships how could
25:04
your relationship with your wife
25:05
actually make a difference in whether
25:09
you develop coronary artery disease or
25:11
arthritis or diabetes how could that
25:13
possibly happen we're learning about
25:15
that now in our research so that's the
25:18
one of the cool things I get to study
25:20
now yeah absolutely and tell me about
25:22
how you were able to deeply define
25:24
social connection and what that warmth
25:27
was because I think also that we can all
25:30
project our own beliefs onto what that
25:32
even is but I'd love to hear your side
25:34
of actually doing the research like what
25:36
was categorized as warm
25:38
and what was categorized is you no
25:40
meaningful social connection to have
25:42
that result yes okay so there are a
25:46
bunch of different ways to think about
25:48
social connection one is literally how
25:51
many people do you see in a given day or
25:53
a given week and that's also important
25:57
so people who see more people tend to
26:02
live longer and healthier compared with
26:05
people who are more socially isolated
26:07
right and is that see one-to-one oh do
26:09
you mean even in the workplace even in
26:11
the workplace now sometimes they're
26:13
they're called weak ties and what that
26:16
means is people we are connected with
26:18
but not that connected so I might see
26:21
someone at work and we have a kind of
26:24
friendly exchange how was your weekend
26:26
and it turns out that that's
26:29
health-promoting as long as they're
26:31
decent exchanges as long as we're not
26:32
snarling at each other
26:34
yeah right it turns out that that is
26:36
health-promoting okay but then in
26:38
addition what you talked about the
26:40
warmth of connection turns out to be
26:42
really important so we're not gonna have
26:44
the closest warmest connections with
26:47
everybody we see during the day but a
26:50
few people if we're lucky
26:51
will be people who we feel like we could
26:54
call on as we asked our participants who
26:58
could you call in the middle of the
27:00
night if you were sick or scared if we
27:02
have some people in our lives like that
27:05
then those are the connections that
27:08
really help keep us healthy times so
27:11
they're people who offer us physical
27:15
support Institute you what we call
27:17
instrumental support they'll drive us to
27:19
the doctor when we need it they'll come
27:21
over and hold our hand when we're
27:22
throwing up
27:24
emotional support so when I have a
27:27
really awful day and I'm feeling
27:30
terrible about my life on my work I can
27:33
talk to somebody and they will help calm
27:35
me down and help me put it in
27:36
perspective and literally I can feel my
27:39
body calm down when that kind of
27:41
conversation happens amazing and often
27:44
often it's your romantic partner but you
27:48
don't have to have a romantic partner to
27:50
have this kind of relationship
27:52
you can have close friends it could be a
27:53
sibling it could be a parent hmm
27:57
but having at least one or two of those
28:00
relationships in the world is really
28:02
important for our health and well-being
28:04
and whether any indicators that
28:06
suggested how to build those or how
28:10
these people were able to achieve that
28:12
with people because I think today what
28:15
we find is there's this struggle of like
28:17
even being able to be expressive about
28:19
our intentions with people or like I I
28:21
have a very open way of behaving so if I
28:24
like someone I'll reach out to them
28:26
after reaching out to them once we've
28:27
met I'll be really clear about where I
28:30
see this going is a friend and I've
28:32
literally said to people that I'm very
28:33
good friends with now that hey I think
28:35
we are gonna get along for life and I
28:37
have this intention that we should be
28:38
friends and sometimes it seems like the
28:40
weirdest thing to say but now they thank
28:42
me like a year later or two year two
28:44
years later and they're like yeah you
28:45
said this to me and it's actually
28:46
happened and I'm like because I thought
28:48
that that's what it was and there will
28:49
be people that I won't see again and so
28:52
I'm just very clear about my intentions
28:53
and that helps me a clarify to other
28:56
people what I want but I can feel scary
28:58
sometimes what have you seen as good
29:00
ways in which people can create those
29:02
meaningful bonds because I think that's
29:04
where we all struggle today I think
29:06
today the challenge is we're surrounded
29:07
by people but we still feel lonely we're
29:10
constantly having a small talk but not
29:13
deep talk we're constantly completely
29:16
filled up with friends and followers but
29:19
no one to call at that time so what does
29:22
it take to get there did you find
29:24
anything around that yes
29:26
so it takes some degree of vulnerability
29:30
meaning I'm gonna risk a little bit and
29:33
the risk is you might reject me or you
29:37
might turn away right so when you said
29:40
to someone I think we get along really
29:43
well and my intention is to be your
29:45
friend yeah the weirdest thing in the
29:47
home it's not good friends no because of
29:50
it it's not weird at all but you made
29:53
yourself vulnerable cuz what if someone
29:55
turns and said yeah J I don't think so
29:57
really nah I don't feel it so much ah
30:00
that would hurt a little right
30:02
so you but you're willing to put
30:04
yourself out there
30:05
now not everybody is gonna feel
30:07
comfortable doing that yes
30:09
what I notice it is it might be so some
30:13
guys are just used to playing basketball
30:16
together or you know playing golf
30:19
together or just watching watching a
30:22
game on television together even asking
30:26
another guy to hang out could be making
30:29
yourself vulnerable like you can feel
30:31
like Oh guys don't do that like if I
30:33
don't happen to run into you or if our
30:35
wives don't arrange it I'm not gonna do
30:38
it
30:39
so my level of vulnerability might just
30:42
be saying to my friend would you get
30:45
together with me on Saturday afternoon
30:47
right that's a big deal
30:49
yes like I would love it if my intention
30:52
if I could say my intention is that
30:54
we're gonna be lifelong friends yeah and
30:56
I think I'm I'm trying to get more to
30:59
that place but I think we eat person has
31:04
to start where they are and so I would
31:06
say if I were to recommend it find out
31:09
where you could be a little bit
31:10
vulnerable with somebody and take that
31:12
risk whatever that might be yes Ian
31:16
trying to make and keep a connection yes
31:19
the other thing is I we found that
31:24
relationships are like it's almost like
31:27
physical fitness like you can't just say
31:30
well we become friends so we're done
31:31
there sure like like I went to the gym
31:34
so I'm done now I don't have to go again
31:36
ever
31:36
mmm no I have to call you up and make
31:41
sure that not too much time goes by
31:43
before we talk before we get together to
31:45
hang out right I've had to learn that in
31:48
my own life and so I do it more with my
31:50
friends because otherwise good
31:52
relationships will just wither away yes
31:55
and nobody means for that to happen so
31:58
relationships will require maintenance
32:00
yes absolutely and one of the ways that
32:03
I've done that practically for myself is
32:04
I know in my mind that there are some
32:06
people that I want to message every week
32:09
there are some people that I message
32:10
once a month and there are some people
32:12
that I speak to every week and there are
32:13
some people I speak to every month and
32:15
just being able to create degrees in our
32:17
life yeah of
32:18
connection has really helped me because
32:20
it allows me to understand that this is
32:22
the level of relationship I have with
32:23
this person and we and what that does is
32:27
it becomes more honest because I think
32:29
we'd like to think that everyone in our
32:31
life is either a best friend or not a
32:32
friend like we like to have this very
32:33
clear black and white but life isn't
32:35
like that there's so many more degrees
32:37
of grey and so many more shades of grey
32:39
and so for me it's far more practical to
32:41
say look these are people that are my
32:43
closest friends the people I talk to
32:45
every day that people I talked about
32:46
everything but then there are people in
32:48
my life that I love seeing once a month
32:49
because they're the people I watch a
32:51
movie with oh they're the people that I
32:52
go out for dinner with and then there
32:53
are people that I see once a year but
32:55
they're amazing too because we've gone
32:56
this great holiday right or whatever it
32:58
may be right and just knowing that you
33:00
can have friends for different purposes
33:02
in different roles in your life rather
33:04
than trying to put everyone into one or
33:06
two which becomes hard pressure for them
33:08
and for yourself yes yes that's a really
33:11
important point the other thing is that
33:13
people can move in and out of your life
33:16
it's not a problem if some relationships
33:20
do fade away because sometimes we're
33:22
only together because we got brought
33:25
together by this other thing like we
33:27
went to college together or something
33:29
else happen and it's okay that
33:31
relationships don't keep up as long as
33:34
we keep up some of our relationships but
33:36
I think you're absolutely right that
33:37
that we can also have different degrees
33:40
of closeness and different degrees of
33:42
involvement and that there's everything
33:44
right with that not that there's
33:46
something wrong with that yeah amazing
33:48
and and I wanted to move forward into
33:49
this you actually went on a three-week
33:52
silent retreat and is that correct yeah
33:54
tell me about what prompted that when
33:56
that was in and what you gained from
33:57
that and why it all came about so I I'm
34:02
Zen practitioner I meditate every day
34:06
how long have you been doing that let's
34:09
talk about that you how did you become a
34:10
Zen practitioner and how did that become
34:12
such a big part of your life I became a
34:14
Zen practitioner by accident okay 13
34:17
years ago um my my son at that time was
34:21
in middle school and his friend was
34:23
having a coming-of-age ceremony at a
34:25
Unitarian Church
34:26
and I went and the I sat next to the mom
34:30
of my son's friend and she knew I was
34:32
interested in meditation I dabbled a
34:35
little she pointed to the minister
34:37
conducting the ceremony and said he's a
34:39
Zen master so I called him up and said
34:42
could I come talk to you and he was this
34:46
wonderful down-to-earth teacher and he
34:49
said come sit with our group
34:51
so I started sitting regularly with a
34:53
meditation group never done that before
34:55
and he and studying with this teacher
35:00
and what I found was that once I sat
35:03
regularly with a group and once I had a
35:05
teacher I could meditate at home yeah
35:07
whereas before I couldn't have a regular
35:09
practice and then I started going to
35:12
meditation retreats silent retreats for
35:15
a few days and then maybe a week and
35:18
then I graduated to a three week silent
35:22
retreat that's the retreat you're
35:23
talking about and and tell me about that
35:26
retreat and what you learned from and
35:28
what you gain from those three weeks of
35:29
silence uh-huh well I learned that my
35:35
mind is a really difficult place to go
35:38
into a loan it's really yeah like so
35:41
much stuff comes up when you are
35:43
watching your mind and the good thing
35:47
was that I was with people who could
35:49
help me understand what was happening
35:51
who had helped me accept the humaneness
35:54
of having a busy mind and a mind that
35:57
made me crazy sometimes and a mind that
36:00
made me anxious and you know and that
36:02
that what this work was of being on a
36:07
silent retreat was learning about my
36:09
humaneness and all the ordinary stuff
36:13
that comes up in a mind that that I came
36:16
to accept more and more and gradually
36:18
even welcome it's like I would like
36:20
chuckle and say oh yeah here it is again
36:22
yeah you know this feeling of I'm
36:25
worthless or this feeling of I've done
36:28
everything wrong in my life or you know
36:30
and then I could understand that these
36:32
are feelings that come and go and that
36:35
they're very natural and
36:38
the more I accepted my own mind and and
36:43
accepted myself the more at ease I
36:46
became with everybody and everything in
36:49
life so this three-week work which was
36:51
like one of the hardest things I'd ever
36:52
done was undoubtedly one of the most
36:55
valuable things I'd ever done and what
36:57
allowed you to push through that barrier
36:59
because I remember the first time I ever
37:00
did silent meditation when I became a
37:02
monk one of the hardest things I believe
37:05
is just getting past that initial
37:06
barrier where all you're hearing is
37:08
noise and it's all-consuming and just
37:12
like wow like there's a lot of noise in
37:14
my mind this is going on and on and on
37:16
and where's this gonna stop and then
37:18
usually that's where we give up yes
37:20
because it's just so frustrating and
37:23
overwhelming yes what allowed you to
37:26
break through and and how would you
37:28
encourage other people to have that
37:29
breakthrough it was through support
37:31
through help from ideally teachers and
37:36
what was that support the support was
37:38
well in Zen the the tradition is in is
37:41
it to have small interviews like it
37:44
might be a two minute or a five minute
37:46
interview with a teacher so you're
37:48
sitting all day in silence but then when
37:51
it's your turn you go in you see the
37:53
teacher you tell him or her what's on
37:56
your mind
37:56
and they really help you with it they
37:58
help you put it in perspective and and I
38:00
could be in agony for several hours and
38:04
then I'd go in and talk to my teacher
38:05
and she would say to me oh yeah this is
38:09
what your mind is doing and we know
38:11
about this and pretty soon it's gonna
38:14
pass and then I'd go out and I'd sit
38:16
again by myself and it would pass
38:17
anyway and seeing and having someone
38:20
guide you and say yes and this is what's
38:22
likely to happen and this is normal was
38:25
like the most relieving thing that could
38:29
happen and then I began to be able to do
38:30
that for myself and that was the key
38:33
like them mornings I would wake up and
38:35
say uh my life is a mess I could then he
38:39
I could then have that perspective of
38:41
okay this happens and I'm not gonna feel
38:44
this way two hours from now yeah and and
38:47
it's knowing that with other people's
38:49
help that really is transform
38:51
absolutely.i I completely agree with you
38:53
and among training was the same and I've
38:55
often said that I think when we first
38:56
start meditating it's so important to
39:00
have a an immersive experience and be a
39:03
guided experience for masters because I
39:05
think the challenge is that if we just
39:07
try and do in our homes immediately it's
39:10
so hard to push through so I think it's
39:11
amazing when we're using apps and doing
39:13
10 minutes a day and I think there's all
39:15
powerful things but I'd love to
39:17
encourage anyone who really wants to
39:19
make meditation a serious practice in
39:20
their life just like anything else when
39:23
you go and do something for half a day a
39:25
day a weekend or a week it becomes so
39:29
much more natural because not only do
39:31
you get the time to have the
39:33
breakthrough you also have the time to
39:35
reap the benefits and therefore when you
39:38
go back to your ten minutes a day or 20
39:39
minutes a day or whatever it may be you
39:41
have that conviction and confidence that
39:43
this has actually worked before exactly
39:45
exactly and don't hesitate to search for
39:50
a guide a teacher who you resonate with
39:53
that you won't resonate with everybody
39:55
and if you're lucky enough to have a few
39:58
people in your local vicinity or even
40:01
online that you could study with find
40:04
it's like a matchmaking find somebody
40:07
who feels like you want to learn from
40:09
them and trust them
40:11
so you wrote an article about you know
40:14
the full powers of quiet or how quiet
40:16
can transform our lives and the first
40:19
quiet you talk about is quiet helps
40:21
clarify what's most important now and
40:23
tomorrow could you share what you mean
40:25
by that for us yes that that often when
40:29
I'm caught up in the busyness of my day
40:31
I get distracted by so many things and I
40:35
think oh that's really important that I
40:38
that I need to to handle these emails
40:40
right now or and then if I stop and
40:43
often this happens when I meditate
40:45
each day the
40:50
the swirl of emails recedes and and I
40:53
and what begins to emerge is something
40:55
more from my heart which is oh I need to
41:00
call my son because I haven't talked to
41:02
him in a while or I really don't want to
41:07
be involved in that project because
41:09
there's something about it that doesn't
41:10
feel right to me and often it's only
41:12
when I'm quiet that my intuition can can
41:17
talk to me right
41:19
that might gut feelings of that's
41:22
probably not a place I want to be
41:24
involved or I really need to spend more
41:26
time here it's only during the quiet
41:28
that my inner voice will start making
41:31
those noises and talking yeah I love
41:33
that
41:34
I completely agree with you it's it's so
41:36
true because otherwise the noise just
41:38
completely overshadows everything else
41:41
and you're so right about also listening
41:43
to our intuition our intuition gets
41:44
buried in the noise absolutely and you
41:47
can't hear your inner voice and the
41:48
noise yeah and so yeah 100% whether your
41:51
second one was quiet allow space for
41:53
contentment and joy yes so today I had
42:00
been in a morning discussion that you
42:03
were in and so many ideas swirling
42:05
around and my head was spinning in my
42:08
head was kind of getting heavy and then
42:11
I said I need to take a break and I went
42:13
out and I said okay I'm gonna sit by the
42:15
lake and simply watch and so I watched
42:20
the water and I watched these birds
42:23
playing in the reeds and I watched an
42:25
ant crawling up my hand and and
42:29
everything just kind of quieted down and
42:32
and I found myself listening to the
42:35
birds and and then feeling like oh my
42:38
god the birds are so amazing and and
42:40
that's often what happens in a meditate
42:42
in a silent meditation retreat where
42:44
people will come into interviews and say
42:46
did you know there are birds outside
42:48
because suddenly they hear with a
42:50
vividness something that just recedes
42:54
into the background all the time and
42:55
that hearing the vividness so the sudden
42:59
vividness of a sound or a or an a or a
43:02
sight
43:04
gives us joy hmm and so that's what
43:06
that's what yeah emerges for me I love
43:09
that
43:10
the third owners quiet reveals the
43:11
emptiness of chasing off to the next big
43:14
thing oh yes um so I work at Harvard
43:22
Medical School and needless to say
43:24
Harvard Medical School places a lot of
43:28
importance on accomplishment and honors
43:31
and titles and of course that inspires a
43:34
lot of good work I mean Harvard Medical
43:36
School is full of wonderful people and
43:38
bright people and caring people but this
43:42
chasing honors and recognition and
43:46
titles can be endless and what I find is
43:51
that this quiet
43:52
and this practice of returning to quiet
43:55
makes me realize okay I don't really
43:57
need that next title and if I got that
44:00
next award I'd get a warm feeling for
44:04
about ten minutes and then it would be
44:06
done and so what do I really want to
44:09
invest my time in is it working for that
44:11
award or is it working for something
44:13
that I care deeply about that might not
44:16
be as bright or shiny or well recognized
44:19
hmm amazing I love that and the fourth
44:22
one is quiet reminds us that we can be
44:24
happy with less yes
44:27
well because so for example today I went
44:32
out and sat by the lake that didn't cost
44:37
anything it didn't require any special
44:40
equipment it's it was nothing it was me
44:45
going and sitting down and so and it's
44:49
also a simplicity so what you realize
44:51
you know we we are constantly told to
44:54
buy things and to pay for new
44:59
experiences and what you realize is that
45:02
just sitting still and paying attention
45:05
brings a kind of joy and a kind of
45:09
happiness that requires no resources
45:12
whatsoever mmm I love that yeah
45:15
absolutely so true there's so many times
45:19
in our day that a free activity could
45:23
actually end up saving us yeah it's not
45:26
just money but saving us internally yes
45:29
and it's completely free it cost nothing
45:31
apart from time yes and a bit of
45:34
presence yes and energy and attention
45:36
but many people will say to me oh I
45:39
can't sit still in meditation I hear
45:41
that all the time let's hear it all the
45:42
time right and I think it's because at
45:44
first our minds are really busy
45:46
yeah and active and that's scary and so
45:49
as you say it's pushing through it's
45:51
allowing yourself enough time for things
45:54
to quiet down yes well I don't know
45:56
about you like I've been so I've been
45:58
meditating for two hours a day for the
45:59
past thirteen years of my life so it's
46:01
been a huge part of my life and I find
46:03
that even today because of myself living
46:05
a very productive lifestyle and
46:08
traveling and social media and
46:11
everything it takes me even when I start
46:13
meditating every morning it takes me
46:15
around ten minutes to just reach choir
46:18
yeah maybe even 15 maybe 20 seconds and
46:21
so if we're only meditating for 10
46:25
minutes and that's what we've only ever
46:26
done I'm not surprised that we only ever
46:29
hear noise yes because if you like so
46:33
when I was among obviously we got to do
46:34
meditations as eight hours long and 12
46:36
hours long and and that was really
46:38
painful and excruciating at first as you
46:40
said but when you push through and so
46:42
that's why I'm encouraging anyone who's
46:44
listening or watching is do that and I'm
46:47
not telling you to do two hours I'm just
46:48
telling you to go to a class or go find
46:50
a teacher whatever and do do half an
46:52
hour with someone like go and dive that
46:54
step further where you can have that
46:56
breakthrough and it's almost like the
46:58
gym - it's like the day you go the first
47:00
day you go to the gym is not the day you
47:01
walk out with the six pack or walk out
47:03
with any of that it's also not the day
47:05
that you fall in love and all the
47:07
machines make sense to you and you know
47:08
what to do it takes time and practice
47:10
and meditation is no different it's just
47:12
a habit that takes a breakthrough and
47:14
and I think we have to be patient with
47:17
it to have that breakthrough exactly and
47:20
to have the experiences which we do have
47:23
sometimes of really feeling better of
47:25
feeling more settled of feeling more
47:28
joy um that we have to get to a point
47:32
where we have those experiences to know
47:34
that they're available to us and that
47:35
they will happen that's it that's
47:37
exactly it
47:38
yeah and and that requires a bit of
47:40
breakthrough so I'm encouraging everyone
47:41
who's listening and watching to just
47:43
take that step through to recognize that
47:46
even after meditating for a long amounts
47:49
of time not just myself everyone that I
47:50
know it still takes time to quiet in the
47:52
mind and when you're in that meditation
47:56
so don't judge yourself don't be hard on
47:59
yourself don't be harsh on yourself it's
48:00
not that you have a messed up mind or
48:03
any of that it's it's just that we do
48:05
live very busy hectic scheduled lives
48:09
yeah the other thing we might encourage
48:12
your listeners to think about is
48:14
noticing those places not where they are
48:18
formally sitting and meditating but
48:20
those places where they're just so
48:22
absorbed in their life that they don't
48:26
even think about it time just passes yes
48:29
it could be that you are sometimes like
48:34
I have a friend who's a carpenter and he
48:36
finds that sometimes when he's
48:37
woodworking he's just in a zone
48:39
some people are skiing down a slope and
48:42
they don't think about anything they're
48:44
just in it and and so you may find that
48:47
my wife plays the piano and she said
48:50
that the piano is her meditation because
48:52
when she is practicing the piano she's
48:56
just lost in it she doesn't think about
48:58
anything else she's just in the zone and
49:00
so I would suggest to people that they
49:03
might see whether there are places in
49:05
their lives it could be gardening it
49:07
could be anything
49:08
see if there are places that are like
49:10
that for you points of time and whether
49:13
you could enjoy those for what they are
49:16
which is a kind of meditative practice
49:18
in itself mmm do them more often and do
49:21
them more often so I wanted to speak
49:23
about this because I've heard you say it
49:25
before and you speak about secure
49:26
attachment and I really was fascinated
49:30
by those two words and I wanted to
49:32
really understand a what secure
49:35
attachment is and be how do we practice
49:38
it
49:39
yes so attachment is the fact that as
49:48
human beings we need other human beings
49:52
from the time were born in fact as we
49:54
know we can't survive as infants unless
49:58
we are connected with at least one other
50:00
person who will give us care and and
50:03
just surround us with care when we're
50:07
young in fact what we know is that
50:09
children in orphanages die if they are
50:13
not given love and not just that it you
50:16
can have all your material needs met you
50:17
can be fed and changed but you will die
50:21
if you're not given some kind of love
50:22
you have to be able to attach to another
50:24
being and we used to think that this was
50:27
simply something that children needed
50:30
infants and then we realized that it
50:32
goes all the way through the lifecycle
50:33
it just takes a slightly different form
50:36
so at a secure attachment in adulthood
50:41
is a relationship where you feel that
50:45
somebody really has your back that they
50:47
will provide a safety net for you as I
50:51
said before that they are the person you
50:52
could call in the middle of the night if
50:54
you're scared or sick mmm
50:56
that to feel like there's somebody in
50:58
the world who will be there for you and
51:00
you can you can have more than one
51:02
person and you can replace attachment
51:05
figures with new people over time and we
51:08
do so initially their parents but then
51:11
it can be friends it can be lovers
51:15
it can be children grown children but to
51:18
have people like that in your life is is
51:20
a secure attachment and part of secure
51:23
attachment is feeling like that person
51:27
will support you in taking risks so as
51:32
an adult if I want to try something new
51:35
so for example I'm now taking singing
51:38
lessons no way that I used to think I
51:41
never thought I could sing but there's
51:44
this great singing teacher in our
51:46
community and so I thought okay like do
51:50
I dare cuz I ever thought I could
51:53
at all so my wife said do it come on
51:57
what do you have to lose she supported
51:59
me in trying something new when and if
52:01
she had said oh you're you can't carry a
52:04
tune don't do it I would have shrunk
52:06
back and said no so that support in
52:09
venturing out into the world is what an
52:12
attachment figure a secure attachment
52:14
relationship can do for us yeah that's
52:17
beautiful yeah and I love how that
52:19
applies so much or compares so well with
52:22
what you said about children that when
52:24
we're children we also need a secure
52:26
attachment to take risks exact so when
52:28
we first start walking except you have
52:31
your mother or your father help you walk
52:33
when you first ride a bike you have
52:35
someone who's running behind you and
52:37
pushing you along and we need as we're
52:39
young as we're kids we need secure
52:42
attachments to take risks and I think we
52:45
forget that as we grow older sact Lee in
52:47
fact if you're if you're ever in a park
52:49
with a mother or a dad and a toddler you
52:52
can see this happen a toddler will
52:55
tentatively start walking away from the
52:58
parent and then start playing and then
53:01
something will happen maybe a bird will
53:03
tweet or some sound will frighten the
53:06
child and they'll run back to the parent
53:08
grab their leg spend a little time there
53:11
and then venture out again and that's
53:13
what we do as adults yeah you know we
53:16
seek comfort and then we can venture
53:17
back out into the world and take risks
53:19
yeah and I love that point specifically
53:21
I think it's true that we all need
53:23
secure attachment but I like the point
53:24
that when we have that secure attachment
53:27
we can actually break forward and what
53:29
about for those of us who sometimes feel
53:31
like and I don't know you feel I'm just
53:33
reflecting on some moments in my life
53:35
some of the biggest moments in my life
53:37
which were high risk or high transitions
53:40
I actually didn't have a secure
53:42
attachment for the decision so I had a
53:45
secure attachment in the in the fact
53:46
that my mom and dad have always loved me
53:48
but they didn't necessarily always not
53:51
that they disagreed but they didn't
53:53
always promote my decisions and so in
53:56
that I've had to take my own steam I own
54:00
secure attachment to really push forward
54:03
if I never did that would never become a
54:05
monk if I never do that I would
54:07
left being a monk and if I never did
54:09
that alone I would never have switched
54:11
and transitioned into doing what I do as
54:13
my purpose today because when I had that
54:17
secure attachment my my parents also
54:19
worried for my health and safety or
54:21
longevity with their parental image
54:24
which was correct right but like when I
54:26
first told my mom I was going to move
54:27
away from my successful corporate job to
54:30
try and teach what I would share what I
54:33
was doing on social media I mean my
54:35
mother just looked at me like are you
54:36
serious like why do you need to do that
54:38
and so why do you need to take that risk
54:40
and so many people around me have always
54:42
had that and I've always found that some
54:44
of the best decisions in my life I had
54:47
to take alone
54:48
yes and you just helped me understand
54:50
that a bit more from letting like that's
54:51
such a good question so I think what
54:54
happens is we can internalize we can
54:57
take in that function that close people
55:02
parents can provide for us so your
55:03
parents probably allowed you to fail at
55:09
some things and helped you with the
55:11
failure so you came home and you didn't
55:14
do well in a soccer match or you know
55:17
something else happened or you didn't do
55:19
well on an exam and your parents helped
55:22
you see that it wasn't the end of the
55:23
world right and that you could get a you
55:26
know pick yourself up and go back out
55:28
there right that experience and being
55:31
helped through that experience probably
55:34
over and over again allows you then to
55:37
do it for yourself right and that's what
55:39
you're seeing so that then you can have
55:41
the the courage to check in on your own
55:44
internal compass so you know no surprise
55:48
that your mother wasn't saying sure go
55:51
leave your jobs or sure go off and be a
55:54
monk yes dear yeah no you know that's
55:57
and so how do you do that you're asking
55:59
how do you do that for yourself and I
56:01
think it's probably because somewhere
56:04
along the way people help you
56:06
internalize that function of being able
56:10
to allow yourself to take the risk
56:13
allow yourself to anticipate I could
56:15
fail at this and
56:17
I will be okay hmm I will take care of
56:19
myself and other people will take care
56:21
of me if my I fail
56:22
yes yes being able to fit its the taking
56:25
the risk and being able to fail that
56:27
allows you to take risks yeah no I think
56:30
that's beautiful and I think you're spot
56:31
on because I remember that when I'd
56:33
perform badly at school or when I'd have
56:36
some sort of challenge in a grade or in
56:39
a class or sport
56:40
my parents would highlight it on that
56:44
day or on that evening so when my
56:47
parents would come back from a
56:48
parent-teacher conference whatever it
56:49
was that was always the most you know
56:51
nerve-wracking thing in the world just
56:53
waiting for your parents to come back
56:55
and you said well your teachers are
56:57
going to say and I already knew what my
56:58
teachers are going to say because I
57:00
naturally excelled in some things and
57:01
didn't in others yeah and I was always
57:04
excelling at the things my parents
57:05
didn't care about yeah and and I didn't
57:07
excel at the things my parents did care
57:08
about and so when they got back I knew
57:11
that I would have to hear it that day
57:13
mmm but then the next day they were back
57:15
to being normal
57:15
yeah and and that's kind of I'm I don't
57:19
know I've this is the first time I'm
57:20
reflecting on that but I found that that
57:22
worked for me because it helped me
57:23
reflect enough to know I wanted to
57:26
improve and grow but it helped me not
57:28
judge myself the next day so I could
57:30
start afresh again and I think some of
57:33
the biggest challenges we have is that
57:34
we keep judging ourselves based on one
57:38
event or one grade or one moment daily
57:41
like we almost extend our judgment based
57:43
on one day or one failure yeah and we
57:45
keep applying that judgment to ourselves
57:47
forever yes and and I think relieving
57:50
ourselves of that judgment on a daily
57:52
basis of you in becoming a ZEM priest
57:55
etc have you thought about judgment at
57:57
all or how that was for yourself and
57:59
others I'm sure that's not about
58:00
judgments so much so what we we talk
58:04
about in in meditation in Zen is the the
58:07
judging mind the mind of right and wrong
58:09
we call it and how easy it is to slip in
58:11
to the mind of right and wrong I'm right
58:14
about this I'm wrong about that or or
58:16
you're right about this or you're wrong
58:18
about that and that that meditation
58:21
helps us to have a bigger perspective
58:23
where right and wrong or often kind of
58:28
relative and kind of not that important
58:30
that of course there are some things
58:31
that are terribly important you know
58:33
about moral moral codes and and a moral
58:37
compass of course but then often the
58:40
right and wrong like well you didn't do
58:43
so well at math but in the grand scheme
58:47
of things you know we look beyond these
58:50
these these judgments and see beyond the
58:53
judging mind to the bigger world where
58:55
you know we look at that tree and we
58:57
don't say oh I wish that tree had
58:59
branches that were a little more like
59:01
this or that tree is not the leaves I
59:04
don't like the design of those leaves so
59:06
well we never do that right now because
59:09
we because nature is beyond the mind of
59:12
right and wrong
59:12
nature is beyond this judging and and so
59:15
in Zen part of the teaching is can we
59:18
get beyond this judging of ourselves and
59:20
others that we just come forward in the
59:23
world as we are and that's fine that's
59:26
like that tree coming forward as it is
59:29
what are the core principles of Zen that
59:31
have really captivated you and other
59:33
lessons like that I love that point you
59:35
just made around nature being beyond the
59:38
judgment of the mind what else are there
59:40
what are the other themes that have
59:41
really stood out to you as core pillars
59:44
of your practice and journey one of the
59:46
core pillars is to understand how
59:52
completely interconnected I am with
59:54
everything in the world everything so
59:57
that I am NOT going out to be in nature
60:03
I am completely part of nature in every
60:05
moment yeah
60:06
and that what you and I are sharing the
60:09
same air we are not separate in so many
60:13
ways and so again that idea then becomes
60:17
if if I win and you lose
60:21
I lose you know if we if we don't all
60:24
rise together nothing can work so so
60:30
this interconnectedness has become
60:32
something that I know more in my bones
60:35
yes that I that I used to pay lip
60:37
service to the intellectually but now i
60:39
and i think meditation really helps me
60:42
to get that yeah in a way that i
60:44
couldn't quite get before I love that
60:46
one thing you've sparked for me there is
60:48
with that interconnectedness I had this
60:52
reflection if I think it was a couple of
60:54
years ago but it was in my study of the
60:56
bhagavad-gita and I was reflecting on a
60:59
lot of these statements that we hear
61:02
today of manifestation attraction the
61:05
universe responding and I was whenever I
61:08
hear statements being thrown around or
61:10
becoming popular in culture I I really
61:12
trying to reflect on where's that come
61:13
from where's the root of that statement
61:15
like where where's the truth in that so
61:17
just like you would check in a study
61:18
it's like for me it's like I want to
61:20
check in a study but I also want to
61:21
check in the bag of Gita in these texts
61:22
and see like where does that come from
61:23
is it real or is it just something
61:25
someone's manufactured and one thing
61:27
that I came across which I'd love to
61:28
share with you because I think it
61:30
applies to what you're saying and I'd
61:31
love to hear your perspective on it is I
61:33
found that if you observe nature
61:36
carefully which you've so beautifully
61:38
said that we are a part of and we are
61:40
nature it's not that I'm going into
61:42
nature we are nature if we look at an
61:45
observe nature carefully nature is
61:47
always serving so the Sun is always
61:50
providing heat and light trees are
61:52
always providing oxygen and shade the
61:55
trees always providing fruits flowers
61:57
that are beautifully scented the water
61:59
is always providing water to drink you
62:02
look at anything in nature it's only
62:04
serving and so therefore the only way to
62:08
align with nature and to be one with
62:11
nature and to be nature is to serve and
62:13
that actually all of our problems come
62:15
from not serving because we're unaligned
62:18
from nature so when we talk about the
62:20
universe responding to us the universe
62:23
responds only when you're aligned with
62:25
it and the only way to be in line to the
62:26
universe is to serve because that's what
62:28
the universe does right does that make
62:30
sense yes it makes total sense and that
62:32
the not
62:33
serving you know cuz I I can be as
62:36
selfish as the next person
62:37
right yeah absolutely and the the
62:39
impulse not to serve is comes in me from
62:42
a place of scarcity like there's not
62:44
going to be enough right and what you're
62:46
describing is that nature is is way more
62:49
than enough that there is this kind of
62:51
fullness about the world yes and that we
62:55
are part of that fullness and when we
62:57
know that then we are free to serve then
63:00
it's not about am I gonna get enough of
63:02
what I need it's that I I already have
63:04
much more than I could ever need yeah
63:07
absolutely and you've sparked a mouthful
63:09
when we used to talk about the spiritual
63:11
west of the material realm we would talk
63:13
about how you know in the material realm
63:15
were used to things being finite when
63:18
you're going to a theater or a cinema
63:20
there's a finite number of seats if you
63:21
go in to watch a sports game there's a
63:23
finite number of seats if you're looking
63:24
to apply for a job there's a finite
63:26
number of jobs it's always limited for a
63:28
xxx applicants a thousand applicants 25
63:30
applicants 60,000 tickets available for
63:33
the World Cup whatever it may be and
63:35
we'd always talk about how you know in
63:38
the theatres of happiness there's an
63:39
unlimited amount of seeds mmm like there
63:42
is no limit on the amount of seats in
63:43
the theatre of happiness at the theatre
63:45
of well-being yes because that's not
63:47
reserved for a specific type of person I
63:50
love that image yeah the other thing I
63:52
would say to riff on a little bit Lee is
63:54
I want to that's is that maybe in the
63:57
theatres of happiness there is a
64:00
particular seat that's yours
64:02
yes agreed agreed 100% that absolutely
64:05
you know if we think about aligning with
64:07
the universe I don't align with the
64:10
universe by becoming like you correct or
64:14
like anybody else I align with the
64:16
universe by finding where I fit
64:19
hugginson
64:20
and where you know and and see feeling
64:23
my way through life in the world right
64:28
absolutely and and if there's a quote
64:29
from Joseph Campbell that I absolutely
64:31
love love Joseph MO he say and you you I
64:34
bet you've used that but the quote is if
64:38
the path before you is clear you're
64:41
probably on somebody else's it's this
64:45
idea that we find our seat in the
64:49
theater of happiness right we find our
64:51
seat in the theatre of service right so
64:55
I'm not gonna serve in the same way you
64:57
are and and so my job is not to become
65:02
as much like you as I can although that
65:04
would be great I actually no no no no I
65:06
totally know I'm totally with you I
65:07
think yeah I I there are many qualities
65:09
I admire but I think it's often that and
65:11
that's probably important so when we
65:13
look at other people we admire or we
65:14
look at a you know a Facebook page and
65:17
we say I want that life that actually
65:19
that's not what we want we really want
65:22
to find where our energy leads us and
65:25
where we align in the universe and and
65:27
Zen has really taught me that yeah I
65:29
love that and I and I agree that
65:31
actually when we inspired by others
65:33
qualities and we see the qualities that
65:35
allowed them to access and open and grow
65:38
or whatever it is those qualities are
65:40
things that we can be imbibing as
65:41
opposed to the ones yeah and I find that
65:44
that's what we always end up is we
65:47
observe people's external journey not
65:49
their internal journey right whereas the
65:51
internal journey is actually similar
65:52
it's the external journey that's
65:54
different than the internal journey of
65:57
self exploration requires a lot of the
66:00
similar things we'll all go through
66:01
break throughs and breakdowns and but
66:03
the external journey doesn't need to be
66:05
the same at all no and and it shouldn't
66:07
be either and it doesn't really happen
66:09
ever I we also and I was I was saying
66:11
that yesterday and I remember I was
66:13
connecting when I was sharing it was the
66:15
the statement in the Gita that says
66:17
better to practice your own path even if
66:19
imperfectly than to practice the path of
66:22
another's perfectly yes and often so
66:24
much of our life is lost in trying to
66:27
practice someone else's path right as
66:29
Joseph Campos who said perfectly like we
66:31
was trying to perfect someone else's
66:34
journey and that's why we climb up that
66:36
ladder and get to the top and go wait
66:38
this is not the tower I wanted to be on
66:40
the top of you know this isn't the wall
66:41
that I was meant to climb and what we
66:44
forget is that the internal journey is
66:46
so similar right that we look at
66:48
external journeys and say well that's
66:50
differ
66:50
from mine or I should be more like that
66:52
but the internal journey is so similar
66:54
for almost all of us and the you know
66:57
there's another saying I like it's that
66:59
that we're always comparing our insides
67:02
to other people's outsides yes right
67:05
that you know because other people you
67:08
know are putting on their game face and
67:10
you know we do we have to do that for
67:13
each other in the world but really it's
67:15
our inner experience that's so similar
67:17
and that when we can share it those are
67:19
the moments that are magical between
67:22
people amazing I love that so in very
67:25
anti anti Zen fashion we're going to end
67:28
with what I call a quick-fire rapid-fire
67:30
round so we do these final five
67:33
questions on every episode and the final
67:35
five questions have to be answered in
67:36
one word or one sentence maximum so I'm
67:40
pretty sure you're gonna be absolutely
67:41
fine at this but like I said we will do
67:44
it and I'll probably get lost in it
67:46
because I'll probably love your own
67:47
season I'll ask you more but the quest
67:50
one is you've said that giving our full
67:51
attention to things is one of the
67:53
hardest things to do what's something
67:55
you always give your full attention to
67:58
my patients when I'm doing psychotherapy
68:04
with somebody my job is to be fully
68:06
present and and so I and I do nothing
68:12
else I there's nothing else set up it's
68:14
just the two of us so in fact I'm
68:16
probably is fully present with you as I
68:18
ever am because we've cleared out most
68:22
distractions yes so so I guess it would
68:26
be that I give my full attention when I
68:29
set up the conditions to be right for
68:31
doing that mm-hmm like like you've done
68:35
here yes or like I do with my patients
68:37
or when I'm lucky and I remember like I
68:40
do with my wife when she wants to tell
68:42
me about her day it's something that
68:44
that I have to engineer and then I can
68:46
be fully present amazing fantastic
68:48
question number two you've been with
68:50
your wife for over 30 years is that
68:52
right what's your favorite or best
68:54
relationship advice that you can give to
68:56
me my audience
68:57
remember that the relationship is going
68:59
to change and that's okay hmm
69:02
that each person is gonna grow and
69:06
develop and that that's not a problem so
69:09
that things are gonna wax and wane that
69:12
you know some of the physical passion
69:14
just isn't gonna be there all the time
69:16
some of the emotional excitement of
69:19
being together isn't gonna be there all
69:20
the time and that doesn't mean there's
69:22
anything wrong with the relationship it
69:24
means that the relationship is a living
69:26
vibrant thing mm-hmm beautiful love the
69:30
question number three if you could have
69:32
everyone in the world do an experiment
69:34
for 30 days and they would be doing one
69:37
activity every day for 30 days what
69:39
would it be it would be to meditate
69:41
every day for 30 days okay
69:43
nope amazing okay question number 4
69:45
what's the first thing you do when you
69:46
wake up
69:46
apart from brushing your teeth or
69:48
showering or any of that normals I'm I
69:50
meditate yeah yeah perfect and you've
69:52
been doing that for now 13 years yeah
69:56
amazing and the fifth and final question
70:00
what is one trait that you think you
70:03
have that has allowed you to create the
70:06
life that you have today what is one
70:07
quality or trait or characteristic that
70:09
you have that you think has been
70:11
integral in in providing happiness and
70:14
well-being in your life but you seem
70:15
like a very happy and I think it's a
70:18
willingness to say I don't know and to
70:27
new things and learn from people and
70:30
just say please teach me because I don't
70:34
know what I'm doing here that I think
70:36
that's that's that's the thing that I
70:40
would hold on to of all the things that
70:43
that of all the qualities I have that's
70:45
the thing I would hold on to because
70:47
it's it cuz it's it's allowed me to get
70:49
into all these new things that I never
70:50
dreamed I would be doing mmm absolutely
70:52
thank you again Robert for doing this
