00:14
What if I told you that breakfast being the most important meal of the day
00:19
was wrong?
00:22
(Laughter)
00:27
What if I told you it is more important when you eat than what you eat?
00:34
Perhaps much of the nutritional dogma that we've been raised with
00:38
is now outdated,
00:40
like snacking all day long and eating many meals.
00:44
Over the next few minutes, I plan to discuss with you
00:47
what I believe to be the most profoundly transformational concept and strategy
00:52
as it pertains to health and aging.
00:55
Over the last 20 years,
00:57
as a nurse practitioner and a functional nutritionist,
01:00
I've seen tremendous shifts,
01:02
tremendous shifts in health and wellness:
01:04
escalating rates of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease -
01:09
many of which are preventable.
01:12
The choices we make in terms of nutrition are profoundly impactful on our health,
01:16
more than most of us realize.
01:21
During my training as a nurse practitioner
01:23
many years ago,
01:25
the dominant nutritional paradigm was exercise more, eat less.
01:31
I've found this to be profoundly ineffective
01:34
for most, if not all, of my female patients.
01:37
The concept of "calories-in, calories-out" alone is just not effective.
01:43
Many of the things that I work with, with my female patients
01:47
really focus on the connection between our lifestyle choices
01:51
and how that impacts healthy aging
01:53
and weight gain.
01:55
I do not believe, nor do I support, the limiting belief
01:59
that women have to accept weight gain as a normal function of aging.
02:06
The National Health and Nutrition Exam Survey,
02:08
which looks at data with regard to children and adults
02:14
in terms of their nutrition and escalating obesity rates,
02:19
compares what went on in the 1970s,
02:23
where most Americans consumed three meals a day
02:26
and no snacks;
02:27
fast forward to today,
02:29
most of what we are doing as Americans is eating three meals a day
02:33
and snacking all day long.
02:37
Really.
02:39
And so one of the things that starts to happen
02:42
when healthcare providers are telling our patients
02:46
that we need to eat all day long -
02:49
it's wrong.
02:51
Eating all day long overtaxes our pancreas and our digestive system.
02:57
It overtaxes it so much that it cannot work properly.
03:01
And if it cannot work properly, we cannot absorb our food
03:04
or the nutrients in that food.
03:07
Another really important distinction when it comes to meal frequency,
03:10
or how frequently we're eating,
03:12
is the debate over sugar burners versus fat burners.
03:17
And when we're talking about that,
03:19
a sugar burner is someone that consumes lots of carbohydrates
03:25
and taps into glucose as their primary fuel source,
03:28
which is incredibly inefficient.
03:30
If you recognize these individuals:
03:32
They are frequently hungry.
03:34
They often get hangry.
03:36
They have - yes - significant dips in their energy level.
03:41
They struggle more with fat loss, and they struggle more with their weight
03:46
because insulin levels are high.
03:48
Insulin is that fat-storing hormone.
03:52
So if levels remain high, we have more oxidative stress;
03:55
we have more inflammation;
03:58
and we struggle more with weight gain.
04:01
In sharp contrast to this are fat burners.
04:04
They tap into fat stores for energy;
04:07
they have sustained energy;
04:08
they are much more clear cognitively;
04:10
they don't get hangry;
04:14
it's easier for them to lose weight
04:16
because they tap into those fat stores;
04:18
they sleep better; and they age more slowly.
04:22
So meal timing and how frequently we are eating - it's absolutely crucial.
04:28
Absolutely crucial.
04:30
Let's talk about some statistics as they pertain to women
04:34
and healthy aging.
04:35
So we know two-thirds of women 40-50 years of age are overweight,
04:41
and more than half are obese.
04:43
How do we proactively address this statistic
04:46
without quick fixes?
04:48
It makes me want to cry
04:51
when my female patients would prefer I write them a prescription
04:55
than work on changing their diet,
04:59
more exercise,
05:00
other lifestyle changes.
05:03
Women in their 50s and 60s gain an average of 1.5 pounds per year.
05:09
Per year. That's average.
05:12
And some of this is attributable to things like hormonal fluctuations,
05:15
women having less lean muscle mass than their male counterparts,
05:19
sleep disturbances and mood disorders.
05:22
However, there are strategies we can use to help offset this.
05:27
So folks, I want you to save your money
05:30
on potions and powders and supplements that are not long-term solutions.
05:35
I've got a better idea.
05:38
And I'm going to tell you about it.
05:40
I've got a better idea.
05:42
There are lots of strategies that I use with my female patients,
05:46
but none more powerful than intermittent fasting.
05:51
Intermittent fasting can help fuel fat loss
05:54
as well as many other benefits that I'll talk more about in a second.
05:58
But it also can improve interpersonal relationships
06:00
and self-esteem.
06:02
And for many women, this permits them -
06:04
it's the magic bullet that allows them to gain back their former selves.
06:10
Really powerful.
06:12
And the really cool thing about intermittent fasting
06:14
is it's free,
06:15
it's flexible and it's simple.
06:18
You take nothing else away.
06:19
Free. Flexible. Simple.
06:22
So let's talk about intermittent fasting.
06:24
It is the absence of food during a prescribed time period.
06:29
You exist either in a fed or a fasted state.
06:33
I'm sure for many of you, you had breakfast this morning.
06:36
So when you eat, insulin is secreted by the pancreas
06:39
to move sugar into the cells.
06:42
We store the bulk of our sugar in our liver and our skeletal muscle.
06:47
But when we exceed those storage sites,
06:51
we store it as fat.
06:53
When we're fasted, insulin levels are low
06:58
and we can tap into fat stores for energy.
07:02
Free. Flexible. Simple.
07:05
And so, when we're talking about intermittent fasting, it's fairly simple.
07:09
If you skip breakfast -
07:11
If you skip breakfast in the morning,
07:13
you can reduce your caloric intake by 20 to 40 percent.
07:17
And the typical time frame that I recommend to my female patients
07:21
is a 16:8.
07:22
Sixteen hours a day fasted with an eight-hour feeding window.
07:27
I know that seems a little overwhelming at first,
07:29
but I'll give you some strategies for how you go about doing that.
07:32
So, the 20-40 percent reduction in calories
07:36
means that you can fuel fat loss.
07:39
So what are some of the benefits other than fat loss -
07:43
fat loss and especially visceral fat around our abdomens,
07:46
around our major organs?
07:48
We know that it improves mental clarity because insulin levels are low.
07:52
We know that it spikes human growth hormone,
07:55
which helps us with lean muscle mass.
07:58
We know that it induces something called autophagy -
08:01
I will speak more about this in a second.
08:03
But this is spring cleaning for the cells.
08:05
It is only evoked when we are fasted.
08:09
Autophagy.
08:11
We know that it lowers insulin levels,
08:13
blood pressure,
08:14
improves our cholesterol profile.
08:18
And we know that it can reduce your risk for developing cancer
08:22
and Alzheimer's disease, which I like to call type 3 diabetes.
08:25
If, for no other reason, we want to protect our brains.
08:31
As wonderful a strategy as this is, it is not for everyone.
08:36
I'm going to talk briefly
08:38
about the individuals that want to avoid this strategy.
08:42
First and foremost, if you are a brittle diabetic,
08:46
or you have difficult-to-control diabetes;
08:49
if you are a child, an adolescent or age greater than 70 -
08:53
might not be the best strategy;
08:56
if you are pregnant;
08:57
if you have chronic heart issues, kidney or renal issues -
09:02
not the best strategy.
09:04
If you have a history of a disordered relationship with food,
09:07
whether it is anorexia, bulimia or binge eating -
09:13
might not be the best strategy because it can invoke those tendencies.
09:16
And last but not least, if you have a low body mass index,
09:20
you're frail
09:21
or you've recently been in the hospital like I was for 13 days.
09:25
I'm not currently intermittent fasting.
09:28
Now, everyone always asks,
09:32
Well, when you're fasting, we know we're not eating food,
09:35
but you can absolutely consume things like filtered water, plain coffee or tea.
09:40
They will not break your fast.
09:42
But when you're ready to eat, what do you eat?
09:45
Now, I would be remiss if I did not mention that there are foods
09:50
that are going to be more advantageous for you to consume
09:53
when you're ready to break your fast.
09:55
So I want you to focus on real whole foods.
10:00
That's what your body needs, wants and deserves.
10:03
So I want you to purchase the best quality protein that your budget permits.
10:07
Ideally, organic or pastured meat, wild-caught fish.
10:11
Healthy fats - so crucial -
10:13
helpful for building healthy hormones
10:15
and also really important for satiety - making sure our taste buds light up,
10:20
make us happy.
10:21
I'm not part of the anti-fat brigade.
10:24
Really, really important.
10:25
Twenty years ago, I might have told you not to eat fat,
10:28
but now we know better.
10:29
So I want you to focus on things like avocados,
10:32
coconut oil, grass-fed butter and nuts - really great, healthy fats.
10:37
Unprocessed carbohydrates.
10:39
Ladies, absolutely crucial,
10:40
if you're in perimenopause, the five to seven years before menopause,
10:44
or you're in menopause,
10:46
quality and quantity are crucial.
10:49
So I want you to consume things like low-glycemic berries,
10:53
green leafy vegetables, squash, quinoa, sweet potatoes
10:58
as opposed to bread and pasta.
11:01
Cautionary tale: I want you to limit sugar and alcohol.
11:06
By that I mean, I want you to not consume those things
11:08
because they can offset all the good that you're doing.
11:11
And lastly, keep yourself well hydrated.
11:15
Now, I want to make sure
11:16
that I briefly touch on some of the practical implications
11:19
for how you would go about starting intermittent fasting.
11:22
Generally, I have my ladies start with 12-13 hours of fasted period.
11:27
And they can slowly increase by an hour or so every day
11:30
until they've reached that 16 hour mark.
11:33
Again, you want to keep yourself really well hydrated.
11:35
You can also have plain coffee or tea.
11:37
In addition to that, you want to ensure that you give it a solid 30 days
11:42
before you determine if it's the right strategy for you.
11:45
And if you have chronic health conditions,
11:47
I want to make sure you discuss it with your healthcare provider.
11:50
Really important.
11:51
And recognize it may take six to eight weeks
11:54
to really see the full benefits of what you're doing.
11:57
The biggest pain point for my female patients is weight gain.
12:02
I have a fantastic strategy to help with this,
12:06
but I don't want you to buy into the next $50 container of protein powder
12:10
or the hottest weight loss supplement that's out there.
12:14
I want you to think about the fact this is a simple, flexible and free option
12:19
that you can try at home,
12:22
discuss with your healthcare provider if necessary.
12:25
I really feel so passionately about this
12:27
because it's something that all of us should be discussing with our patients.
