00:00
I'm thinking about something that you
00:04
said in in something you wrote which
00:09
gets to this question of democracy but
00:15
you mentioned just in passing
00:20
teenage girls if they have a free
00:24
Saturday afternoon they like to walk
00:27
around in the shopping mall rather than
00:31
going to the library so I found that
00:37
very thought-provoking because I think
00:42
that many people and I would have to
00:45
include myself believe that deep deep
00:52
down what we all really want is material
01:00
comfort for ourselves that this is what
01:04
we all want more than anything else we
01:07
we we may make an effort and go to the
01:12
library we may make an effort and vote
01:18
we may make an effort and go to work or
01:23
even visit a sick friend or say a
01:28
friendly word to someone who is in
01:30
trouble but what we really would like to
01:35
do is sit on a big comfortable sofa and
01:40
watch a an entertaining program on a big
01:46
beautiful television set and maybe have
01:51
somebody bring us some hot fudge sundaes
01:55
or
01:57
bonbons while we're watching the program
02:00
that this is what people what I'm really
02:04
like what what everyone is really like
02:11
selfish and and really seeking material
02:17
comfort and that that is human nature
02:21
that is bedrock human nature and I think
02:25
a lot of our political attitudes come
02:28
from the fact that we think we can never
02:31
get away from that that's what we are
02:33
now do you share that view not the list
02:38
and I think there's plenty of evidence
02:41
against it there is has been a massive
02:44
effort for over a hundred years to try
02:48
to convince people that that's what we
02:51
are
02:51
it's called advertising there's it's a
02:55
huge industry it's dedicated explicitly
02:59
openly to trying to you read the
03:02
business press 100 years ago and it's
03:04
taking off to try to direct people to
03:09
the superficial things of life like
03:11
fashionable consumption get them out of
03:14
our hair by getting them involved in
03:17
consumption and huge efforts go into
03:21
this
03:22
for example about 20 or 30 years ago the
03:25
advertising industry realized that
03:27
there's a sector of the population that
03:31
they're not reaching because they don't
03:33
have money known as children so then
03:36
some bright guys figured well we can get
03:39
around this the children don't have
03:41
money but their parents do so what we
03:44
have to do is direct television programs
03:47
for children and so on to try to induce
03:52
what's called nagging try to get that
03:55
this is literally the case create
03:57
nagging propaganda by now if you look at
04:01
academic Applied Psychology departments
04:05
there
04:05
actually programs studying different
04:07
kinds of nagging and how you can induce
04:09
it and if you watch children's
04:11
television I've seen this with my
04:12
grandchildren because two year old kids
04:15
are looking at things and they're being
04:17
induced to try to get your parents to
04:20
get me this thing or else I'm gonna die
04:23
you know and so on then the parents get
04:26
it and you throw it away in five minutes
04:27
but every aspect of our life is devoted
04:31
to this okay my wife and I but were
04:35
taken by a friend a couple of weeks ago
04:37
to see a what do you call it the
04:41
baseball you know the prepper is a
04:44
pre-season baseball spring right and you
04:49
take a look at the stadium every inch is
04:52
covered with an ad I mean I remember
04:54
first baseball game I went it was in the
04:57
1930s there were no ads anywhere now
05:00
every inch is an ad every taxicab you
05:04
look at is a not every minute of your
05:06
life is inundated with efforts to turn
05:09
you into the kind of person you're
05:11
describing
05:12
so is that human nature I don't think so
05:15
so take a look at these Trump voters
05:17
again say these working-class people and
05:20
say rural towns which manufacturing
05:23
towns and Arkansas and take a listen to
05:26
what they're saying these are people who
05:28
men want to work in coal mines which is
05:32
not fun rather than to take a government
05:35
handout they don't want to sit on the
05:38
couch and being given a government
05:40
handout that undermines their sense of
05:43
dignity of self-worth of doing something
05:46
significant and I think that's what
05:48
people are you go back further plenty of
05:52
evidence for it there's there's a
05:55
wonderful study huge study of the
05:58
reading habits of the British working
06:01
class in the late 19th century Jonathan
06:04
rose very detailed say what were British
06:07
workers reading it turns out they were
06:09
better educated than
06:11
than the aristocrats American say
06:15
eastern Massachusetts Boston where I
06:17
live the an Irish blacksmith if he could
06:22
make enough money would hire a boy to
06:24
read to him while he's working I'm not
06:27
gonna remember this from childhood in
06:29
the 1930s most of my family were for
06:33
immigrants you know first first
06:35
generation unemployed working-class
06:38
quite educated many of them didn't go to
06:41
school though maybe fourth grade but
06:43
they read they went to concerts they
06:47
went to Shakespeare plays they talked
06:49
about it they were interested in
06:50
politics I mean I think it's taken huge
06:54
efforts to try to drive all of this out
06:56
of people's heads I think the natural
06:59
thing for humans is to want to be
07:01
independent creative whether created I
07:06
mean maybe you work on a you know fixing
07:10
up old cars in your garage in the
07:13
weekend instead of sitting in the
07:14
watching television whatever it may be
07:16
you want to do something that's
07:19
significant that's worth that's
07:21
worthwhile maybe even if it's a ugly
07:24
horrible job like working in a coal mine
07:26
instead of taking a government handout
07:28
because people I think want dignity and
07:31
a sense of self-worth and a sense of
07:33
creating and doing something important
07:36
that's what we are and I think it's
07:38
taken huge effort enormous efforts a
07:42
huge part of the economy is devoted to
07:44
trying to drive these things out of
07:47
people's heads to make you think that
07:49
all you want is more commodities so you
07:52
should go shopping instead of reading
07:54
nothing so that people most people by
08:02
this account really have been
08:07
unnaturally squashed into being
08:10
something much much smaller than they
08:14
could be or than he should be and want
08:16
to be and want to be in fact it's pretty
08:19
interesting to go back to
08:22
studies of the working-class press in
08:25
the early industrial revolution in the
08:30
United States earlier in the United
08:32
States it would be mid 19th century late
08:35
19th century it was a very lively
08:37
working class press a lot of it written
08:40
by young women young women from the
08:43
farms that called Factory girls who ran
08:46
their own newspapers and the material is
08:48
a lot of material on and it's pretty
08:50
interesting that what they wanted was
08:54
dignity they hated the industrial system
08:57
because it was turning that it was
08:59
destroying their rights as independent
09:03
people they attacked what sometimes they
09:07
called the idea the slogan they
09:11
denounced the slogan gain wealth for
09:14
getting all but self in other words the
09:17
kind of person that you think we all are
09:19
that we're taught we all are that's what
09:22
they were condemning we don't just gain
09:24
wealth for getting all but self we want
09:27
dignified independent lives they
09:30
regarded wage labor as not very
09:33
different from slavery which was just a
09:36
popular idea that was a slogan of the
09:38
Republican Party literally Abraham
09:41
Lincoln and so on because it takes what
09:43
you're selling yourself if you're a wage
09:45
laborer if you sell something you
09:48
created let's say you're an artisan and
09:50
you make something and you sell it
09:52
you're not selling yourself if you sell
09:55
your labor you're selling yourself
09:56
you're losing your dignity and
09:59
independence it's an attack on your
10:01
fundamental rights these are themes that
10:03
run right through the spontaneous
10:07
productions of mostly uneducated
10:10
working-class what we call uneducated
10:12
working-class people it was the same in
10:15
England before us and I think it's the
10:17
same elsewhere I just don't think people
10:19
are when you talk about human nature I
10:22
think we're talking about something
10:24
that's constructed and contrived with
10:26
enormous effort conscious effort
10:31
but you look at in in the television
10:36
industry there's what's called content
10:39
and fill in a program the content is the
10:44
ads the fill is the car chase that you
10:48
pull off the shelf to keep people
10:50
watching between the ads and if you just
10:52
watch television you can see that the
10:55
creativity the thought the funding and
10:59
so on is going into the ads and not into
11:02
the fill you know the newspaper industry
11:05
there's what they call the news hole so
11:08
you lay out the newspaper first to get
11:10
all the ads that's what matters then
11:11
there's this put in things to keep
11:14
people watching I mean this is literally
11:17
hundreds of millions dollars a huge part
11:20
of the economy goes into this that
11:23
interesting aspect of this which is kind
11:25
of interestingly not studied very much
11:28
has to do with basic economics so anyone
11:32
who took an economics course or reads
11:35
about it knows that the a market economy
11:41
is supposed to be based on informed
11:45
consumers making rational choices that's
11:49
what we're taught our economy is turned
11:53
on the television set and take a look at
11:56
the content the ads are they trying to
11:59
create informed consumers making
12:02
rational choices I mean if we had a
12:04
market economy if there was an ad it
12:08
would be an announcement by say Ford
12:11
Motor Company here are the
12:13
characteristics of the cars I think
12:15
there's a nice here here's what consumer
12:18
review says about them that would create
12:21
informed consumers making rational
12:23
choices it's not what you see there's
12:27
huge efforts to try to create irrational
12:31
consumers uninformed consumers making
12:33
irrational choices to undermine market
12:37
economies yes and to turn people into
12:40
people who believe may even believe that
12:43
what they want us to sit on a couch and
12:45
watch television so it's not what they
12:46
want as yeah yeah I almost I think we
12:58
could end there it's in I think I don't
13:04
know IIIi think this is a perfect place
13:07
to I mean we could go on for hours but I
13:14
think maybe this is the perfect place to
13:17
stop really
13:19
oh no they don't want us stuff all right
13:22
I'll ask you I'll ask you one more
13:24
question that just comes up
