```

Do you have one of these?
00:20
I got a little obsessed with mine.
00:22
In fact I got a little obsessed with all my stuff.
00:24
Have you ever wondered where all the stuff we buy, comes from
00:27
and where it goes when we throw it out?
00:29
I couldn't stop wondering about that. So I looked it up.
00:32
And what the text book said, is that stuff moves through a system
00:35
from extraction to production to distribution to consumption to disposal.
00:41
All together, it is called the materials economy. Well, I looked into it a little bit more.
00:46
In fact, I spent 10 years traveling the world,
00:49
tracking where our stuff comes from and where it goes.
00:52
And you know what I found out? That is not the whole story.
00:55
There's a lot missing from this explanation.
00:58
For one thing, this system looks like it's fine. No problem.
01:03
But the truth is it’s a system in crisis.
01:05
And the reason it is in crisis is that it is a linear system
01:09
and we live on a finite planet
01:11
and you can not run a linear system on a finite planet indefinitely.
01:15
Every step along the way, this system is interacting with the real world.
01:19
In real life it’s not happening on a blank white page.
01:23
It’s interacting with societies, cultures, economies, the environment.
01:26
And all along the way, it’s bumping up against limits.
01:29
Limits we don't see here because the diagram is incomplete.
01:33
So lets go back through, let's fill in some of the blanks and see what's missing.
01:37
Well, one of the most important things its missing is people, yes people.
01:41
People live and work all along this system.
01:44
And some people in this system matter a little more than others;
01:47
Some have a little more say. Who are they?
01:50
Well, let’s start with the government.
01:52
Now my friends tell me I should use a tank to symbolize the government
01:55
and that’s true in many countries and increasingly in our own,
01:58
after all more than 50% of our federal tax money is now going to the military,
02:02
but I’m using a person to symbolize the government
02:04
because I hold true to the vision and values that governments should be
02:07
of the people, by the people, for the people.
02:10
It's the governments job to watch out for us, to take care of us. That’s their job.
02:15
Then along came the corporation.
02:17
Now, the reason the corporation looks bigger than the government
02:20
is bigger then the government.
02:22
Of the 100 largest economies on earth now, 51 are corporations.
02:28
As the corporations have grown in size and power, we’ve seen a little change in the government
02:32
where they’re a little more concerned in making sure
02:35
everything is working out for those guys than for us.
02:37
OK, so lets see what else is missing from this picture.
02:40
We'll start with extraction.
02:42
which is a fancy word for natural resource exploitation
02:45
which is a fancy word for trashing the planet.
02:48
What this looks like is we chop down trees, we blow up mountains to get the metals inside,
02:53
we use up all the water and we wipe out the animals.
02:55
So here we are running up against our first limit.
02:58
We are running out of resources. We are using too much stuff.
03:03
Now I know this can be hard to hear, but it's the truth we’ve gotta deal with it.
03:07
In the past three decades alone,
03:09
one-third of the planet’s natural resources base have been consumed. Gone.
03:15
We are cutting and mining and hauling and trashing the place so fast
03:19
that we’re undermining the planet’s very ability for people to live here.
03:23
Where I live, in the United States, we have less than 4% of our original forests left.
03:29
Forty percent of the waterways have become undrinkable.
03:32
And our problem is not just that we’re using too much stuff,
03:36
but we’re using more than our share. We have 5% of the world’s population
03:41
but we’re consuming 30% of the world’s resources and creating 30% of the world’s waste.
03:47
If everybody consumed at U.S. rates, we would need 3 to 5 planets.
03:52
And you know what? We’ve only got one.
03:54
So, my country’s response to this limitation is simply to go take somebody else’s!
03:59
This is the Third World, which – some would say –
04:02
is another word for our stuff that somehow got on someone else’s land.
04:06
So what does that look like? The same thing: trashing the place.
04:10
75% of global fisheries now are fished at or beyond capacity.
04:15
80% of the planet’s original forests are gone.
04:19
In the Amazon alone, we’re losing 2000 trees a minute.
04:23
That is seven football fields a minute.
04:26
And what about the people who live here?
04:29
Well. According to these guys, they don’t own these resources
04:32
even if they’ve been living there for generations, they don’t own the means of production
04:36
and they’re not buying a lot of stuff. And in this system,
04:39
if you don’t own or buy a lot of stuff, you don’t have value.
04:44
So, next, the materials move to “production“ and what happens there is we use energy
04:48
to mix toxic chemicals in with the natural resources to make toxic contaminated products.
04:54
There are over 100,000 synthetic chemicals in use in commerce today.
04:59
Only a handful of them have even been tested for health impacts
05:02
and NONE have been tested for synergistic health impacts,
05:05
that means when they interact with all the other chemicals we’re exposed to every day.
05:08
So, we don’t know the full impact on health and the environment of all these toxic chemicals.
05:12
But we do know one thing: Toxics in, Toxics Out.
05:16
As long as we keep putting toxics into our inudstrial production systems,
05:19
we are going to keep getting toxics in the stuff that we bring
05:22
into our homes, and workplaces, and schools. And, duh, our bodies.
05:26
Like BFRs, brominated flame retardants.
05:29
They are a chemical that make things more fireproof but they are super toxic.
05:33
They’re a neurotoxin–that means toxic to the brain What are we even doing using a chemical like this?
05:40
Yet we put them in our computers, our appliances, couches, mattresses, even some pillows.
05:46
In fact, we take our pillows, we douse them in a neurotoxin
05:50
and then we bring them home and put our heads on them for 8 hours a night to sleep.
05:53
Now, I don’t know, but it seems to me that in this country with so much potential,
05:57
we could think of a better way to stop our heads from catching on fire at night.
06:01
Now these toxics build up in the food chain and concentrate in our bodies.
06:05
Do you know what is the food at the top of the food chain
06:08
with the highest level of many toxic contaminants? Human breast milk.
06:12
That means that we have reached a point where the smallest members of our societies - our babies
06:18
are getting their highest lifetime dose of toxic chemicals from breastfeeding from their mothers.
06:24
Is that not an incredible violation?
06:27
Breastfeeding must be the most fundamental human act of nurturing;
06:31
it should be sacred and safe. Now breastfeeding is still best
06:36
and mothers should definitely keep breastfeeding, but we should protect it. They should protect it.
06:41
I thought they were looking out for us. And of course,
06:45
the people who bear the biggest of these toxic chemicals
06:47
are the factory workers, many of whom are women of reproductive age.
06:51
They’re working with reproductive toxics, carcinogens and more.
06:55
Now, I ask you, what kind of woman of reproductive age
06:59
would work in a job exposed to reproductive toxics,
07:02
except for a woman with no other option? And that is one of the “beauties” of this system?
07:07
The erosion of local environments and economies here
07:11
ensures a constant supply of people with no other option.
07:14
Globally 200,000 people a day are moving from environments
07:19
that have sustained them for generations,
07:21
into cities, many to live in slums, looking for work, no matter how toxic that work may be.
07:27
So, you see, it is not just resources that are wasted along this system,
07:31
but people too. Whole communities get wasted.
07:34
Yup, toxics in, toxics out.
07:37
A lot of the toxics leave the factories in products,
07:40
but even more leave as by-products, or pollution. And it’s a lot of pollution.
07:45
In the U.S., our industry admits to releasing over 4 billion pounds of toxic chemicals a year
07:51
and it’s probably way more since that is only what they admit.
07:54
So that’s another limit, because, yuck,
07:56
who wants to look at and smell 4 billion pounds of toxic chemicals a year? So, what do they do?
08:01
Move the dirty factories overseas Pollute someone else’s land!
08:05
But surprise, a lot of that air pollution is coming right back at us, carried by wind currents.
08:10
So, what happens after all these resources are turned into products?
08:15
Well, it moves here, for distribution.
08:18
Now distribution means “selling all this toxic-contaminated junk as quickly as possible.”
08:23
The goal here is to keep the prices down, keep the people buying, and keep the inventory moving.
08:29
How do they keep the prices down? Well, they don’t pay the store workers very much
08:33
and they skimp on health insurance every time they can. It’s all about externalizing the costs.
08:38
What that means is the real costs of making stuff aren’t captured in the price.
08:43
In other words, we aren’t paying for the stuff we buy.
08:46
I was thinking about this the other day.
08:48
I was walking and I wanted to listen to the news
08:50
so I popped into a Radio Shack to buy a radio.
08:53
I found this cute little green radio for 4 dollars and 99 cents.
08:56
I was standing there in line to buy this thing and I was thinking
08:59
how could $4.99 possibly capture the costs
09:03
of making this radio and getting it into my hands? The metal was probably mined in South Africa,
09:08
the petroleum was probably drilled in Iraq, the plastics were probably produced in China,
09:13
and maybe the whole thing was assembled by some 15 year old in a maquiladora in Mexico.
09:17
$4.99 wouldn’t even pay the rent for the shelf space it occupied until I came along,
09:22
let alone part of the staff guy’s salary who helped me pick it out,
09:25
or the multiple ocean cruises and truck rides pieces of this radio went on.
09:29
That’s how I realized, I didn’t pay for the radio. So, who did pay?
09:34
Well. These people paid with the loss of their natural resource base.
09:37
These people paid with the loss of their clean air with increasing asthma and cancer rates.
09:43
Kids in the Congo paid with their future – 30% of the kids in parts of the Congo
09:48
now have had to drop out of school to mine coltan,
09:49
a metal we need for our cheap and disposable electronics.
09:53
These people even paid, by having to cover their own health insurance.
09:56
All along this system, people pitched in so I could get this radio for $4.99.
10:02
And none of these contributions are recorded in any accounts book.
10:05
That is what I mean by the company owners externalize the true costs of production.
10:11
And that brings us to the golden arrow of consumption.
10:16
This is the heart of the system, the engine that drives it.
10:19
It is so important that protecting this arrow has become the top priority for both of these guys.
10:25
That is why, after 9/11, when our country was in shock,
10:28
and President Bush could have suggested any number of appropriate things:
10:31
to grieve, to pray, to hope. NO. He said to shop. TO SHOP?!
10:37
We have become a nation of consumers. Our primary identity has become that of being consumers,
10:44
not mothers, teachers, farmers, but consumers.
10:47
The primary way that our value is measured and demonstrated
10:51
is by how much we contribute to this arrow, how much we consume. And do we!
10:56
We shop and shop and shop. Keep the materials flowing, And flow they do!
11:02
Guess what percentage of total materials flow through this system is still in product or use 6 months after the date of sale in North America?
11:06
Fifty percent? Twenty? NO. One percent. One! In other words, 99 percent of the stuff
11:21
we harvest, mine, process, transport – 99 percent of the stuff we run through this system
11:25
is trashed within 6 months. Now how can we run a planet
11:30
with that level of materials throughput? It wasn’t always like this.
11:35
The average U.S. person now consumes twice as much as they did 50 years ago.
11:39
Ask your grandma. In her day, stewardship and resourcefulness and thrift were valued.
11:44
So, how did this happen? Well, it didn’t just happen. It was designed.
11:49
Shortly after the World War 2, these guys were figuring out how to ramp up the economy.
11:55
Retailing analyst Victor Lebow articulated the solution
11:58
that has become the norm for the whole system.
12:00
He said: "Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life,
12:05
that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction,
12:10
our ego satisfaction, in consumption.
12:13
We need things consumed, burned up, replaced and discarded at an ever-accelerating rate.”
12:18
President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors Chairman said
12:22
that "The American economy's ultimate purpose is to produce more consumer goods."
12:26
MORE CONSUMER GOODS?
12:28
Our ultimate purpose? Not provide health care, or education, or safe transportation,
12:34
or sustainability or justice? Consumer goods?
12:37
How did they get us to jump on board this program so enthusiastically?
12:41
Well, two of their most effective strategies are planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence.
12:46
Planned obsolescence is another word for “designed for the dump.”
12:50
It means they actually make stuff to be useless as quickly as possible
12:54
so we will chuck it and buy a new one.
12:56
It’s obvious with things like plastic bags and coffee cups, but now it’s even big stuff:
13:00
mops, DVDs, cameras, barbeques even, everything! Even computers.
13:05
Have you noticed that when you buy a computer now,
13:08
the technology is changing so fast that in just a couple years,
13:10
it’s actually an impediment to communication? I was curious about this
13:14
so I opened up a big desktop computer to see what was inside. And I found out
13:18
that the piece that changes each year is just a tiny little piece in the corner.
13:22
But you can’t just change that one piece, because each new version is a different shape,
13:27
so you gotta chuck the whole thing and buy a new one.
13:30
So, I was reading industrial design journals from the 1950s when planned obsolescence
13:35
was really catching on. These designers are so open about it.
13:38
They actually discuss how fast can they make stuff break
13:42
that still leaves the consumer having enough faith in the product
13:45
to go out and buy anther one. It was so intentional.
13:48
But stuff cannot break fast enough to keep this arrow afloat,
13:51
so there’s also “perceived obsolescence.”
13:54
Now perceived obsolescence convinces us to throw away stuff that is still perfectly useful.
14:00
How do they do that? Well, they change the way the stuff looks
14:04
so if you bought your stuff a couple years ago,
14:06
everyone can tell that you haven’t contributed to this arrow recently
14:10
and since the way we demonstrate our value is contributing to this arrow, it can be embarrassing
14:15
Like I’ve have had the same fat white computer monitor
14:18
on my desk for 5 years. My co-worker just got a new computer.
14:21
She has a flat, shiny, sleek monitor.
14:25
It matches her computer, it matches her phone, even her pen stand.
14:28
She looks like she is driving in space ship central and I,
14:32
I look like I have a washing machine on my desk.
14:35
Fashion is another prime example of this. Have you ever wondered why women’s shoe heels
14:40
go from fat one year to skinny the next to fat to skinny? It is not because there is some debate
14:44
about which heel structure is the most healthy for women’s feet. It’s because wearing fat heels
14:48
in a skinny heel year shows everybody that you haven’t contributed to that arrow recently
14:53
so you’re not as valuable as that person in skinny heels next to you,
14:56
or, more likely, in some ad. It’s to keep buying new shoes.
15:01
Advertisements, and media in general, play a big role in this.
15:05
Each of us in the U.S. is targeted with over 3,000 advertisements a day.
15:09
We each see more advertisements in one year than people 50 years ago saw in a lifetime.
15:14
And if you think about it, what is the point of an ad except to make us unhappy with what we have?
15:18
So, 3,000 times a day, we’re told that our hair is wrong, our skin is wrong,
15:22
our clothes are wrong, our furniture is wrong, our cars are wrong, we are wrong
15:25
but that it can all be made right if we just go shopping.
15:28
Media also helps by hiding all of this and all of this,
15:31
so the only part of the materials economy we see is the shopping.
15:35
The extraction, production and disposal all happen outside our field of vision.
15:40
So, in the U.S. we have more stuff than ever before,
15:44
but polls show that our national happiness is actually declining.
15:47
Our national happiness peaked in the 1950s, the same time as this consumption mania exploded.
15:54
Hmmm. Interesting coincidence.
15:57
I think I know why. We have more stuff,
16:00
but we have less time for the things that really make us happy:
16:02
friends, family, leisure time. We’re working harder than ever.
16:07
Some analysts say that we have less leisure time now than in Feudal Society.
16:12
And do you know what the two main activities are
16:14
that we do with the scant leisure time we have?
16:16
Watch TV and shop.
16:18
In the U.S., we spend 3 to 4 times as many hours shopping
16:22
as our counterparts in Europe do. So we are in this ridiculous situation
16:25
where we go to work, maybe two jobs even, and we come home and we’re exhausted
16:29
so we plop down on our new couch and watch TV and the commercials tell us “YOU SUCK”
16:32
so we gotta go to the mall to buy something to feel better, and then you gotta go to work more
16:36
to pay for the stuff you just bought so you come home and you’re more tired
16:39
so you sit down and watch more T.V. and it tells you to go to the mall again
16:41
and we’re on this crazy work-watch-spend treadmill and we could just stop.
16:47
So in the end, what happens To all the stuff we buy anyway?
16:50
At this rate of consumption, it can’t fit into our houses
16:52
even though the average house size has doubled
16:54
in this country since the 1970s. It all goes out in the garbage.
16:57
And that brings us to disposal. This is the part of the materials economy
17:02
we all know the most because we have to haul the junk out to the curb ourselves.
17:05
Each of us in the United States makes 4 1/2 pounds of garbage a day.
17:10
That is twice what we each made thirty years ago.
17:13
All of this garbage either gets dumped in a landfill, which is just a big hole in the ground,
17:17
or if you’re really unlucky, first it’s burned in an incinerator and then dumped in a landfill.
17:23
Either way, both pollute the air, land, water and, don’t forget, change the climate.
17:29
Incineration is really bad.
17:31
Remember those toxics back in the production stage?
17:34
Well burning the garbage releases the toxics up into the air.
17:37
Even worse, it makes new super toxics. Like dioxin.
17:42
Dioxin is the most toxic man made substance known to science.
17:45
And incinerators are the number one source of dioxin.
17:49
That means that we could stop the number one source of the most toxic man-made substance known
17:54
just by stopping burning the trash. We could stop it today.
17:59
Now some companies don’t want to deal with building landfills and incinerators here,
18:02
so they just export the disposal too. What about recycling? Does recycling help?
18:08
Yes, recycling helps. reduces the garbage at this end
18:13
and it reduces the pressure to mine and harvest new stuff at this end.
18:16
Yes, Yes, Yes, we should all recycle. But recycling is not enough.
18:20
Recycling will never be enough. For a couple of reasons.
18:24
First, the waste coming out of our houses is just the tip of the iceberg.
18:28
For every one garbage can of waste you put out on the curb,
18:32
70 garbage cans of waste were made upstream
18:35
just to make the junk in that one garbage can you put out on the curb.
18:38
So even if we could recycle 100 percent of the waste coming out of our households,
18:42
it doesn’t get to the core of the problems. Also much of the garbage can’t be recycled,
18:47
either because it contains too many toxics, or it is designed NOT to be recyclable in the firs place
18:53
Like those juice packs with layers of metal and paper and plastic
18:57
all smooshed together. You can never separate those for true recycling.
19:03
So you see, it is a system in crisis. All along the way, we are bumping up limits.
19:08
From changing climate to declining happiness, it’s just not working.
19:13
But the good thing about such an all pervasive problem
19:15
is that there are so many points of intervention.
19:17
There are people working here on saving forests and here on clean production.
19:22
People working on labor rights and fair trade
19:24
and conscious consuming and blocking landfills and incinerators
19:28
and, very importantly, on taking back our government
19:31
so it is really is by the people and for the people.
19:34
All this work is critically important but things are really gonna start moving
19:39
when we see the connections, when we see the big picture.
19:42
When people along this system get united, we can reclaim and transform this linear system
19:47
into something new, a system that doesn’t waste resources or people.
19:52
Because what we really need to chuck is this old-school throw-away mindset.
19:56
There’s a new school of thinking on this stuff and it’s based on sustainability and equity:
20:00
Green Chemistry, Zero Waste, Closed Loop Production,
20:04
Renewable Energy, Local living Economies.
20:08
It’s already happening. Now some say it’s unrealistic, idealistic, that it can’t happen
20:13
But I say the ones who are unrealistic are those that want to continue on the old path.
20:17
That’s dreaming.
20:19
Remember that old way didn’t just happen. It’s not like gravity that we just gotta live with
20:25
People created it. And we’re people too. So let’s create something new.
