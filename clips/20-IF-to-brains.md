How Intermittent Fasting Boosts Brain Power | Mark Mattson

What I'm gonna tell you today is that fasting does good things for the brain.
00:06
One thing that happens when you fast that does not happen when you eat three meals a
00:11
day is that your energy metabolism shifts so that you start burning fats.
00:18
And you produce what are called ketone bodies.
00:20
Now it turns out, ketone bodies are very good for your brain and I'll talk about that in
00:26
a minute.
00:28
So what do I mean by intermittent fasting or intermittent energy restriction?
00:31
There's a lot of variations that are being used on this.
00:34
This book called the 8 hour diet - there's evidence that if you restrict the time window
00:40
that you eat each day to eight hours or less, that's long enough to shift the energy metabolism.
00:47
OK why does fasting bolster brain power?
00:51
Fasting is a challenge to your brain and your brain responds to that challenge of not having
00:57
food by activating adaptive stress response pathways that help your brain cope with stress
01:05
and resist disease.
01:08
Why is it that way?
01:11
Well, if you're hungry and haven't found food, you better figure out how to find food.
01:18
You don't want your brain to shut down and in fact, that's what we find in the animals
01:22
- nerve cells circuits are more active.
01:26
Some of the changes in the brain that occur with intermittent fasting also occur with
01:30
vigorous exercise.
01:32
Exercise and intermittent fasting both increase the production of proteins in the brain that
01:37
are called Neurotrophic Factors.
01:39
We found that these neurotrophic factors such as FGF and one called BDNF, brain derived
01:45
neurotrophic factor, promote the growth of neurons, promote the connection of neurons
01:50
and strengthening of the synapses.
01:53
Recently we discovered that fasting by increasing BDNF levels in the brain, this neurotrophic
01:59
factor, can increase the number of mitochondria in your nerve cells.
02:05
I mentioned ketones which come from burning fat and that happens during fasting.
02:11
We're doing... my work in my lab trying to understand why ketones are good for neurons
02:15
- one reason is they provide an alternative fuel for the neurons that boost the energy
02:20
levels in the neurons.
02:22
So, I'm gonna end with this slide and thank you very much for your attention and try it
02:31
out.
02:32
You can just play around with this, and you'll find on the days that you don't eat so much,
02:36
you're more productive.
02:37
Thank you.
