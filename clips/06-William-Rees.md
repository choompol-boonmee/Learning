00:01
And how much of the earth is needed to support just me in the style to which I am accustomed?
00:11
You, you know when I... I'll show you where the 'footprint' came from. I was very fortunate.
00:19
Well, not only was I what I ate...
00:21
but I grew what I ate. I was therefore growing me. And when that thought hit me, this was my epiphany, Stuart...
00:29
I felt as if somebody had pulled my chair out from under me, and I was in free fall into the Earth.

01:02
I'm speaking with Dr. William (also knowns as Bill) Rees,
01:08
who is an emeritus professor of...
01:12
Ecology and Ecological Economics from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and
01:19
he was working with the —
01:22
—It's the school of community and regional planning. It's it's part of the Faculty of Applied Sciences.
01:28
This is a loaded question: why wasn't ecological economics being taught in the economics faculty?
01:37
Well, because ecological economics starts from a completely different set of premises from normal
01:43
or mainstream neoliberal economics
01:46
Neoliberal economics considers the economy and the ecosphere—or environment, as they call it—
01:54
to be essentially separate systems. And they don't have any important connection.
01:58
So if you start from that perspective and you believe that technology can resolve any resource shortages,
02:07
then there's no reason to think of constraints on growth.
02:10
Ecological economics, on the other hand, starts from the premise that the human subsystem
02:15
— I call it the human enterprise—is a subsystem of the ecosphere,
02:20
and that it draws on the ecosphere for all of the energy and material that it requires to
02:26
maintain itself and grow. And, in the process of using that energy and material, considers a vastly larger
02:33
quantity of waste—much a bit toxic—which it then dumps back into the ecosphere, further reducing the productivity of it.
02:44
So in effect, if you take the ecological economics perspective and you see the human system
02:50
is a subsystem of a larger system, the subsystem is constantly growing the larger system is not.
02:58
And so you have what is effectively in, I suppose, structural terms a parasitic relationship.
03:05
But the human Enterprise is literally
03:07
consuming the ecosphere from the inside of it. I used to call it the maggot in Earth's apple, so to speak.
03:15
And it's a fundamentally unsustainable relationship.
03:19
And using our tool, called methodological footprint analysis,
03:23
It's been relatively—not easy—but we can show that the earth has been—
03:27
or that the human enterprise has been in a state of overshoot for some couple of decades now.
03:33
And that simply means that to just maintain itself and grow at the current relatively slow pace
03:39
the human enterprise is destroying the productivity of ecosystems faster than they can regenerate.
03:47
And we are dumping wastes into natural systems much more rapidly than they can be processed or assimilated
03:54
or recycled by the natural system. Even climate change is a waste management problem.
03:59
It's driven at least in part by anthropogenic emissions of, say, carbon dioxide.
04:05
And carbon dioxide is the single greatest entropic waste, by weight, of industrial economies.
04:12
So almost any of our, so-called "environmental problems," which are really problems
04:17
of the human enterprise, are understandable from the perspective of
04:24
recognizing that humans are parasitic on the larger system and have currently outgrown
04:30
the capacity of that system to sustain even our current levels of consumption.
04:48
Entropic means dispersed.
04:51
So we're talking about dispersing our carbon dioxide for free into the vast sewer of the atmosphere—
04:58
which is not a sewer. But yeah the way it's treated
05:01
Yeah, basically in simplest terms entropy is a measure of disorder
05:06
So in order to produce something as simple as my little mouse here,
05:11
we have to import a vast quantity of highly ordered energy rich materials. We refine it
05:18
and process it, and finally produce this thing.
05:21
But this represents a tiny fraction of the total amount of valuable energy and materials that were
05:28
extracted from the environment and then dissipated back into the environment as entropic waste.
05:34
So we create a small piece of order like this, but at the expense of vastly increasing the disorder
05:41
in the ecosphere.
05:43
All out of sight, out of mind. And that is basically the voodoo of our current system—
05:52
is that we don't have to focus. We don't tip—"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain there."
05:58
Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.
06:00
And you can even use this concept of entropy to understand how the overshoot concept works,
06:07
because the ecosphere isn't—you know, earth isn't a wonderful planet that just happens to be perfect for life.
06:15
The living processes on the planet have created the ecosphere—
06:20
the conditions for life as we know it—
06:22
So for example, all of the oxygen in the atmosphere is a product of biological activity,
06:28
as is most of the nitrogen.
06:30
Absent biological functions, then the atmosphere of Earth would be similar—or more similar—
06:35
to that of Mars Venus, which is mostly carbon dioxide.
06:38
So, over the course of some four billion years life has evolved—or co-evolved—with the
06:45
non-living components of the ecosphere to create what we call the environment suitable for life.
06:51
But it's life producing the circumstances that continue to enable life itself to exist. And it's a long bumpy road.
06:59
I mean, at one point there was no
07:01
oxygen producing bacteria or plants on the planet. When they emerged and began producing oxygen
07:17
which then displaced a bunch of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere—it's actually an exchange process—
07:23
much of the then-living life-forms died out. They were poisoned by the atmosphere of oxygen.
07:30
So, but the point is the existence of oxygen, produced now mostly by green plants and algae and so on,
07:37
made possible the emergence of animal forms and oxygen-breathing organisms
07:42
that now are the most visible of the life-forms that we consider similar to ourselves on the planet.
07:50
Bottom line: earth creates—the ecosphere creates, the basis for its own existence.
07:56
But it does that—and here's where the entropy law comes in—by using solar energy.
08:02
So, the sun's energy arrives on the planet. A portion of it is captured by green plants.
08:08
And they use it to assemble the complex biological molecules from which all life depends.
08:16
Now in the process, they dissipate that solar energy back into the universe as degraded waste heat—
08:21
as infrared radiation, basically.
08:24
So life creates itself by dissipating the Sun.
08:28
Right? All life on the earth is the result of the entropic law at work.
08:34
We extract high-grade solar energy. We produce the complex molecular structures
08:39
that all life depends upon.
08:41
We then—not we, but life processes dissipate the solar energy off the planet.
08:46
And we use this huge reserve that is built up of organic molecules, through photosynthesis,
08:52
to produce all of the human enterprise, for example.
08:56
Even fossil fuels are ancient photosynthesis that has been processed by geological forces into a usable fuel.
09:03
But the point—the bottom line is that if the consumption—the rate of destruction—of this highly ordered material
09:11
that the living processes have produced—the forests, the deep soils, the fossil fuel—
09:19
if the destruction that precedes vastly more rapidly than it's being produced by the photosynthetic processes
09:25
in the first place, we're in a state of imbalance.
09:27
And we've long since reached that point.
09:31
We've only pushed up global temperatures by around point eight degrees centigrade
09:36
But because of the 40 or 50 year time lag between emissions and temperature rise,
09:42
the emissions already in the atmosphere commits us to raising temperatures by around another 0.6ºC,
09:49
over the coming decades, which could easily be enough to place us right at the peak of the hill,
09:55
or even over it.
09:59
If we do pass this critical threshold, global temperatures could soar by as much as 6ºC.
10:10
The human system, in order to grow itself, is destroying the forests. It's destroying the oceans. It's depleting the land.
10:21
Don't tell me about it while I'm making money. I'm busy.
10:25
There we are.
10:27
It's nothing—I mean, we have to consume to exist. The point is though it's a question of scale.
10:34
And scale is just a matter of size. So on the one hand we share this planet with tens of millions of other species.
10:43
Some of them are producers. Those are the green plants and algae and so on,
10:47
that extract the photosynthetic energy and use it to create complex molecular structures.
10:53
But it's on those complex molecular structures that all animal life depends.
10:58
Now, literally tens of—hundreds of thousands of animal species depend on that photosynthetic process.
11:04
And 99.9999% of them are in equilibrium.
11:09
They're not using their ecosystems faster than those ecosystems can sustain the energy and
11:14
material flows needed to support them. One species has gone rogue, and because of our technological capacity—
11:23
Who might that be?
11:25
Oh! Well, let me give you a clue. One of them is sitting in your seat.
11:31
Oh! Oh yeah!
11:33
And it's not with you. It's you! So what humankind has done—
11:38
Normally in nature, species are held in check by negative feedbacks.
11:44
Every species has the capacity to expand exponentially. But normally that doesn't happen because
11:50
They run on food or they get too crowded and diseases come in,
11:59
predators hit them, or whatever. So there's this uneasy balance. The balance of nature isn't a balance.
12:04
It's a constant disequilibrium. We are in constant disequilibrium between positive and negative forces.
12:12
But what humans did, particularly with the advent of fossil fuels, was to eliminate the negative forces.
12:19
So basically, fossil energy has enabled us to
12:24
appropriate all of the other energies and materials that have been required to grow the human enterprise.
12:31
Prior to the use of fossil fuels, we couldn't do that.
12:34
We couldn't even feed, you know, our own species adequately.
12:38
But with fossil fuels, we vastly increased food production.
12:41
We vastly increased access to minerals and forest products and all the other things needed to grow the enterprise.
12:47
At the same time, we mastered disease, or at least we understood better how to control disease.
12:54
We got rid of any major predators, obviously.
12:57
So the point is that, relieved of all of these negative feedbacks that were always in check,
13:04
the human enterprise was able to exercise its full biological potential, which is this exponential expansion.
13:12
So in just the last 200 years—it's astonishing how rapidly that this all has taken place!
13:17
It took us as a species, let's say, 200,000 years of modern humankind—
13:24
It took the first 200,000 years to reach a billion people.
13:29
And that's because for all of that period of time we were in equilibrium in our local environments,
13:34
with the diseases, the resource scarcity, the famines that came along from time and time.
13:41
So we were in more or less equilibrium. With fossil fuels, in just 200 years—
13:48
that's 1/1,000th as much time as it took to reach our first billion—we blew up to almost 8 billion.
13:57
Now that's an astonishing, utterly unprecedented, totally unusual event. And yet,
14:04
everyone alive today, plus the last seven or eight generations, lived during that period,
14:10
that 200-year period.
14:12
So we take it to be the norm.
14:15
This is how—one of the reasons why the modern
14:19
human enterprise considers growth to be a normal part of existence.
14:24
And we've adopted this paradigm of perpetual economic growth driven by ever advancing
14:30
technological gains, which enable us to scour more and more out of the earth's bounty.
14:36
But the irony is that the period we take to be the norm is the single most
14:41
anomalous or abnormal period in the history of our species. —Completely anomalous, yes.
14:47
And as a result, we're destroying the very basis of our own existence.
14:51
And we can't see it because we are embedded like that within that that 200-year bubble.
14:58
Exactly.
14:59
While you brought up fossil fuels, I thought of—one of the things I used to say, when I was giving
15:06
active presentations about the climate problem, which is that these fossil fuels are
15:12
200 million years of stored sunlight.
15:16
Now, I don't know if I have the right word. 200 million—it's probably a lot more than that.
15:20
But we basically have figured out how to get the sunlight that was stored in plant and animal material,
15:28
and sequestered under the ground. And then and we're sucking the planet dry.
15:33
We're just leaving it out through all the little nooks and crannies we can.
15:37
Putting it up in the atmosphere. Putting the waste products—the greenhouse gas—up in the atmosphere
15:40
as quickly as we possibly can.
15:43
Having a great party of doing it. And I'm reminded of Richard Heinberg's
15:49
"The Party's Over"
15:50
his book talking about, 'hey, what happens when we run out guys?' And the graph that he shows: You are here.
16:01
So, yeah, and the other thing that Richard Heinberg says is—since I brought them up—
16:04
is that, I think of every ten calories we eat,
16:08
nine calories is fossil fuel energy.
16:12
Yeah, basically. It's interesting. Again, if you go back just 150 years before mechanical,
16:18
fossil-powered agriculture, you knew that every calorie on your plate of food was generated by the Sun.
16:25
Either directly—plants growing, using solar energy—
16:30
or harvested through human and animal labor, which is solar energy, basically.
16:35
So every calorie was solar energy.
16:38
Now, if we compare the quantity of energy used to produce a calorie on our plate,
16:44
ten times as much fossil fuel is used as is contained within the food, itself.
16:50
That number may be a bit dated. It may be more or less today. But the fact is that the vast
16:55
proportion of the energy required to produce a calorie of food is no longer solar. It's fossil fuel.
17:02
It means, you know, if fossil fuel is a finite resource,
17:06
or we have to stop using it because of climate change, then our food production system is
17:12
clearly in a very different, difficult situation.
17:16
My father rode a camel. I ride a Mercedes-Benz.
17:21
My son drives a motorcycle—
17:26
BMW or Harley motorcycle. His son will ride a camel.
17:31
Yeah, that's the—
17:33
a lot of people who study energy,
17:36
believe that we will go back to having to base the whole of the human enterprise on basically
17:42
contemporary solar energy: photosynthesis.
17:46
And that's a big problem.
17:48
What's the timeline on that, given that there's no certainty of anything?
17:53
If humanity manages to get over this hump that we're in—not just a pandemic, the coronavirus hump—
18:00
but the general onslaught of the ecosphere smacking us silly,
18:08
how long do you see before we actually have to start working on net solar energy and not stored?
18:16
Well, I think you underscored it. Who was it? Who said that making predictions is very difficult,
18:22
especially about the future...?
18:25
We never know what's down the pipe. We do know this:
18:29
Fossil fuel is a limited resource.
18:33
The petroleum, in particular, is a limited resource.
18:39
There's plenty of coal, I understand.
18:42
Some argue that in any case the current pandemic has so damaged the
18:47
petroleum industry and the natural gas industry, that it will never recover to its former heights.
18:53
So we may well—some argue we did pass
18:57
—we passed peak production of conventional fuels in 2005, and we probably passed peak
19:04
production of other forms of petroleum—shale gas in the United States; tar sands oil in Canada—around 2018.
19:14
So it's downhill from here, in terms of the potential for fossil fuel.
19:19
And despite all the hype we hear of a wind and solar and so on,
19:23
they're simply not adequate substitutes in quantity for the fossil fuel energies, which may now be in decline.
19:31
The bottom line is this: In my view—and again
19:34
we're dealing with extremely complex systems and predictions are extremely hazardous—
19:40
but I think we should be conserving fossil fuel.
19:44
The major way to create energy on the planet today is through massive conservation efforts.
19:50
Because it's estimated that we in North America waste probably 50% of all the fossil energy that we use,
19:57
either just because of in efficiencies, or through frivolous uses that contribute no real value to society.
20:04
So we need to begin conserving fossil fuels. If we could save 50 percent, we achieve our
20:11
climate change objectives.
20:13
Under the Paris commitments.
20:15
That's right.
20:17
And, at the same time, we need to begin to allocate the use of fossil fuels to those essential uses
20:24
for which there are no substitutes.
20:26
So we can't grow our agricultural economy
20:30
with alternative energy, at present.
20:32
Intercity transportation is almost totally fossil fuel dependent.
20:36
Without fossil fuels—and no substitute—large cities like New York—any megacity,
20:41
even any large city of a million or two—can't exist on this planet.
20:45
We simply have no way of provisioning them, of connecting them to the resource supplies
20:52
that they need on a daily basis. Most cities—again, this goes to our ecological footprint analysis—
20:58
People think the city is a small spot on the map.
21:00
In fact some economists say, 'Look the world is vastly empty!
21:04
Of course, you can support a trillion people on the planet!
21:07
Just flyover and you'll see the vast empty spaces.'
21:10
But if each person in the city in North America
21:14
requires the equivalent of, say 14 acres or 6 hectares, or there abouts, to sustain themselves,
21:21
the size of a city is not the place on the map. That's just where we keep our bodies.
21:26
The actual, biophysical size, the ecological size, the ecological footprint of that city may be anywhere from
21:33
a couple of hundred to a thousand times larger than the
21:37
built-up area on the ground. So when you think of cities in those terms and realize that every single day a
21:45
massive truck fleet, a massive shipping fleet, a massive bunch of aircraft are bringing into the city the organized,
21:53
negentropic energy and material it needs to sustain itself—and by the way,
21:57
dumping all of that processed materials back into the
22:00
ecosphere as waste—the city is a very different thing from the static way that geographers and
22:06
sociologists look at it. It's a living, breathing entity with a massive footprint on the planet and a huge
22:14
entropic load. It's just creating the most massive quantities of waste you can possibly imagine—
22:20
which again explains why our oceans are filling up with plastics and figurative material.
22:25
Dead zones are increasing. The vast areas of agricultural land on the planet
22:30
are actually urban land because they're dedicated to supplying food for the city or to livestock or feed lots,
22:38
which are extensions the human system. See these are the human equivalent of livestock feed lots.
22:44
They don't support themselves.
22:46
They need products brought in from everywhere else. And the major product, in a biophysical sense, is waste.
22:53
And that's the case with the livestock feed lot. It's also the case with city.
22:56
We don't see it though because we shuttle it away and sewer systems and dump it into the atmosphere
23:02
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!
23:04
Yeah, exactly right.
23:06
Or rose-colored glasses. I need to buy a pair of rose-colored glasses to to slip on occasionally
23:11
in these conversations.
23:13
We've vast quantities of rose-colored glasses all over the planet. Most people wear them all the time, I'm afraid.
23:20
The term ecological footprint,
23:23
you were the originator—or the co-originator, with your then grad student Mathis Wackernagel—
23:31
of the concept of Ecological Footprint, from which has come Carbon Footprint and Freshwater Footprint and
23:39
all of all of the other 'Footprints' that have been developed, and the ways of measuring them
23:44
or approximating them, which is in itself ahuge accomplishment in
23:51
paradigm shifting, in mimetic engineering.
23:54
Getting humanity to realize that everything we do has an impact, a footprint.
24:01
And the footprint is a particularly good image because... what happens when you step on a flower?
24:09
It suffers. And we are eight—
24:13
nearing a billion of us stepping on all kinds of flowers. So—and sacred cows.
24:19
Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. And what the footprint shows is the power of metaphor.
24:26
Right. It's an incredibly powerful metaphor because people—everybody can understand
24:31
what a footprint is and you recognize it's a mark on the land.
24:35
And everybody recognizes what land is. And when we begin to show folks that, you know, you!—
24:42
You know what, I'll show you where the footprint came from. I was very fortunate.
24:46
I spent much of my youth on my grandparents' farm in southern Ontario.
24:52
And it was a general-purpose farm. This goes back to the late 40s and 1950s.
24:58
So we are entirely self-sufficient. And we gathered—there were several of us young cousins,
25:04
who worked as cheap laborers—we were on the farm in the summertime.
25:08
But we would gather on my grandmother's summer porch for an enormous
25:12
summer meal at noon. We'd been working in the fields all day; we'd be going out again.
25:18
So we had huge spreads. But everything on the table we had grown ourselves. And one day I sat there waiting—
25:26
we were waiting for my grandfather to come in and say grace—and I looked at my plate and I realized,
25:31
every single item—from the new carrots and fresh tomatoes, to the chicken and beef—we did both!
25:39
I had a hand in growing. And as a kid—I probably was eight or ten years old—
25:45
I had this incredible sense of—you know the expression, 'you are what you eat'?
25:51
Well, not only was I what I ate,
25:53
but I grew what I ate. I was there for growing ME. And when that thought hit me, this was my epiphany, Stuart.
26:01
I felt as if somebody had pulled my chair out from under me, and I was in freefall into the earth.
26:06
I felt utterly connected to the earth.
26:10
And at that point in my youth, at the age of 10 or so,
26:15
I formulated this question:
26:17
how much of the earth is needed to support just me in the style to which I am accustomed?
26:24
Now, that's a little more sophisticated, I suppose, then I thought of it as a child.
26:27
But the point is I understood
26:30
that the earth.... I was a product of the earth.
26:35
I'm at university ten years later! That's where the footprint came from:
26:40
the idea to explore, as an ecologist, the actual area of the earth's surface needed,
26:48
through its processes of production and assimilation and consumption and recycling
26:54
and all of these wonderful things that take place in ecosystems—how much of the earth's surface
26:59
is dedicated to supporting just me in the style of which I am accustomed?
27:04
And I think that should be the first question of human ecology and, by the way, economics as well.
