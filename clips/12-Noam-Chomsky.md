Noam Chomsky full length interview: Who rules the world now?
https://youtu.be/P2lsEVlqts0


00:00
Mr Chomsky that impotence of voters, that angry impotence as you talk about, presumably
00:05
you’d say that is what is responsible for the rise of Donald Trump, is it?
00:11
It’s pretty clear what is responsible for the rise of the support for Trump and there’s
00:19
general agreement about it. If you take a simple look at economic statistics, the primary
00:26
support for Trump is coming from mostly white working class poor people who’ve been cast
00:36
by the wayside during the neo-liberal period. They’ve lived through a generation of stagnation
00:44
or decline. Real male wages are about what they were in the 1960s. There has also been
00:53
a decline in functioning democracy, the overwhelming evidence reveals that even their own elected
01:02
representatives barely reflect their interest and concerns. A contempt for institutions,
01:09
especially congress has just increased, skyrocketed it’s down single digits often. These are
01:18
people who, meanwhile there has of course been wealth created, it’s gone into very
01:26
few hands, mostly into a fraction of the top 1%. So there’s enormous opulence.
01:34
Yes indeed and how dangerous do you think this all is in terms of Donald Trump for example.
01:40
I mean he has been toning down some of his most extreme pronouncements recently. He may,
01:46
if he ever got anywhere near power, he could be held in check by congressman. How dangerous
01:50
do you think he is to America? Well the greatest danger that he and indeed
01:58
every republican candidate poses is barely mentioned. It’s kind of reminiscent of Sherlock
02:05
Holmes’ dog that did not bark. The greatest danger is – there are two huge dangers that
02:15
the human species faces. We’re now in a situation where we have to decide whether
02:21
the species survives in any decent form. One is the rising danger of nuclear war, which
02:28
is quite serious. The other is environmental catastrophe. Now on these issues Donald Trump
02:34
and the other republican candidates are basically uniform. On the threat of nuclear war.
02:42
And do you believe that Hilary Clinton, the democratic frontrunner, would champion those
02:47
issues in a way that would satisfy you? Not in any way that would satisfy me, but
02:54
at least she recognises that climate change is going on and that we have to do something
03:01
about. Every single republican candidate denies that it’s happening, with the soul exception
03:08
of Kasich who says sure it’s happening but we shouldn’t do anything about it and that’s
03:14
having an impact. The Paris negotiations last December were aiming at a treaty, they couldn’t
03:23
reach it for a simple reason; the republican congress would not accept it. So it’s a
03:30
voluntary agreement which means even the weak standards that we’re proposed will be barely,
03:38
maybe it undermines the likelihood that even they will be met. Every Republican candidate,
03:44
including Trump wants to eliminate the environmental protection agency, Richard Nixon’s legacy,
03:51
to cut back regulation to restart the press of business quickly as possible. On militarism,
03:59
every one of them wants to raise the huge military budget, already over half of discretionary
04:05
spending leading right now. It’s one factor leading to confrontations which could be extremely
04:13
hazardous and this again is not being discussed. And briefly, I’d suggest one thing that
04:19
you might agree with Donald Trump on would be about the EU. He talks about the UK may
04:26
leave the EU, you’ve railed against European Union bureaucracy. Could you agree with him
04:32
on that? No I don’t. In fact I actually have no real
04:38
strong opinion on Brexit but my concern about it would be that it would weaken the European
04:47
Union but it would also probably leave Britain even more, don’t want to use too strong
04:54
a word, subordinate to US power than it is today. Which I don’t think would be a good
05:00
thing for the world or Britain. What in a nutshell is the answer to “Who
05:04
rules the world now?” As I try to discuss in the book, there is
05:11
no simple answer. We usually think of states when that question is raised and with regard
05:19
to states there’s no doubt that the United States, despite its decline for many many
05:26
years, is still overwhelmingly more powerful than any state or group of states. But that’s
05:33
only one factor. States have internal structures. An internal distribution of power. In the
05:42
United States power is overwhelmingly and increasingly, in recent years, in the hands
05:48
of a very narrow sector of corporate wealth, private wealth and power. And they have counterparts
05:56
elsewhere who agree with them, who interact with them largely and that’s another dimension
06:02
in who rules the world. And there’s also the public. The public can have, sometimes
06:08
does have, enormous power. We can go back to David Hume, first major modern work on
06:17
political philosophy. Foundations on the theory of government pointed out that force is on
06:23
the side of the governed, those who are governed have the force if they are willing to and
06:29
eager to and recognise the possibility to exercise it. Sometimes they do. That’s a
06:36
major force in who rules the world. But when it comes to state power, you don’t
06:41
buy the idea of China as the next superpower, the imminent superpower?
06:47
China? I mean China plays a very important role in the world undoubtedly. If you take
06:54
a look at say per capita income, it’s far behind the United States and other developed
07:01
states. It has enormous internal problems, demographic, ecological, resources and so
07:11
on. It’s undoubtedly going to play an important, in military terms it’s not even a fraction
07:16
of the United States and Western powers. So yes, economically it’s significant but bear
07:24
in mind that a good deal of Chinese production is actually far unknown. Apple, world’s
07:32
major corporation happens to produce in China, largely, but that’s US production which
07:40
happens to use Chinese facilities, labour and other facilities. So China is a growing,
07:49
developing power, in some domains in fact it’s gone quite far even in the high technology
07:57
industry. So for example in production of solar panels, China’s in the lead, not just
08:04
in mass production but also in innovation and high tech development. All of this is
08:11
significant but it is by no means of power on the scale of the United States. In fact
08:16
take a look at the confrontations between China and the United States now. There are
08:22
serious confrontations. Are they in the Caribbean? Are they off the coast if California? No,
08:29
they’re in waters around China where China and others have territorial claims. That’s
08:39
symbolic reflection of the nature of state power.
08:44
Well you describe, scathing about the United States, no one will be surprised to hear that.
08:50
You described it as a leading terrorist state. I’m just interested how you’d describe
08:57
Russia. How I describe Russia? Authoritarian, brutal,
09:05
harsh. Carrying out ugly actions in its own region. The United States on the other hand
09:13
carries out such actions all over the world. In fact again, look at the – there are serious
09:18
confrontations between Russia and the United States and once again are they on the Mexican
09:25
border? The Canadian border? No, they’re on the Russian border. In fact right at the
09:31
point of the traditional invasion route through which Russia has been virtually destroyed
09:41
several times in the past century, also earlier history. Again, that’s no apologetics for
09:49
what Putin may be doing but it should lead us to understand, have a rational perspective
09:57
on the relationship between these forces in the world. As for the U.S. being the leading
10:02
terrorist state I should say that’s hardly just my opinion. So for example I noted when
10:09
I was introduced, the person who introduced me said that I regard the United States as
10:18
the gravest threat to world peace. That’s not exactly, it a little misrepresents the
10:25
situation. There are international polls run by the leading U.S. polling agency, Gallop,
10:32
its international affiliates Gallop/WIN and one of the questions they ask is “which
10:39
country is the greatest threat to world peace?” and the United States is first by a huge margin.
10:46
Far behind in second place is Pakistan, that’s undoubtedly inflated by the Indian vote and
10:53
others have slight mention, so that’s global opinion. And I should mention that this was
11:02
not even reported in the United States, happen to be reported by the BBC but wasn’t reported
11:07
in the United States. As for being a terrorist state, President Obama’s global assassination
11:15
campaign, draw an assassination campaign, is extreme terrorist war. I mean if Iran,
11:23
let’s say was carrying out a campaign to assassinate people around the world who would
11:31
thought might be planning to harm Iran, we would regard it as terrorism. For example,
11:38
if they were bombing the editorial offices of the New York Times and The Washington Post
11:45
which publish [ ] by prominent figures saying that we should bomb Iran right now, not wait.
11:53
So obviously they want to harm Iran. Suppose Iran was assassinating them and anybody who
11:59
happened to be standing around, all over would we regard that as terrorism? I think we would.
12:05
Let me put a few questions to you from people online. People are sending in questions off
12:11
our Facebook. First Gary says what are the dangers of T Tip?
12:20
Putin? The dangers are- No, Sorry. What are the dangers or T TIP?
12:32
The Transatlantic Trade Partnership? TTIP? Oh, TTIP? They’re pretty extreme. In fact
12:36
Greenpeace, a couple of days ago, released 280 pages of internal documents on this so-called
12:47
trade agreement and they spell out details of what all of us should know. The so-called
12:55
free trade agreements are not free trade agreements. In fact to a large extent they’re not even
13:00
trade agreements. These are investor right agreements. There’s a reason why they’re
13:05
kept secret from the public and as soon as you look them you see why. Notice I say secret
13:12
from the public, not secret. They’re not kept secret, they’re not secret to the corporate
13:18
lawyers and lobbyists who are writing the detailed regulations. Of course in the interests
13:24
of their constituents, doesn’t happen to be the public of the world or their own countries.
13:31
So these are highly protectionist for the benefit of private power, so-called intellectual
13:39
property rights, effectively raise tariffs. They’re called patents but which have an
13:48
enormous impact on economies. Great, wonderful for pharmaceutical and media court conglomerates
13:55
and others. Investors, corporations are given the right to sue governments, something you
14:10
and I can’t do but a corporation can, to sue governments for harming their future,
14:17
potentially future profits. You can figure out what that means and such cases already
14:23
in the courts – they’re not in the courts they go to private trade adjudication groups
14:30
made up largely of corporate representatives. They’re already going on with NAFTA and
14:37
we can expect more of them. There are provisions that undermine efforts at regulation including
14:45
incidentally, regulation of environmental dangers and rather strikingly the phrase “Climate
14:56
Change” does not appear in these 280 pages, which are illustrative of the whole structure.
15:05
So they have almost no, I should say that these agreements, so-called Pacific and Atlantic
15:11
have virtually no effect on tariffs. Tariffs are already quite low among the major trading
15:18
partners. When you read the propaganda about it, it says “oh yeah sure, Vietnam is going
15:23
to have to lower its tariffs.” Yeah, almost no effect on trade. The major trading partners
15:30
already have agreements that have reduced the terrorists very substantially. There are
15:36
few exceptions, not many. So these are basically – we should disabuse our self of the illusion
15:43
that these are free trade agreements, anything but. And to a large extent not even trade
15:49
agreements. We have the experience of others like NAFTA, many years of experience. So take
15:55
say NAFTA, it has all of the aspects that I just described but even more. Consider even
16:03
what is called trade. Interactions across the US-Mexico border, they’ve increased
16:11
substantially since NAFTA. So economists will tell you trade is greatly increased but have
16:17
a look at them. So for example, suppose that General Motors produces parts in Indiana,
16:26
sends them to Mexico for assembly and sells the car in Los Angeles. That’s call trade
16:35
in both directions, but it’s not. Its interactions internal to a command economy. It’s as if
16:43
during the days of the Soviet Union, parts were made, say in Leningrad, sent to Warsaw
16:52
for assembly and sold in Moscow. We wouldn’t call that trade. That’s interactions internal
17:00
to a command economy. Well Noam Chomsky, Thank you very much for
17:05
being so generous with your time and for staying on to have that live online discussion. Thank
17:08
you.
