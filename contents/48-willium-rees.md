the end of the world scenario 
will be rised with an unimaginable horror,
however we believe that the pre-end
period will be filled with unpresented 
oppotunities for profit.

the dilemma between intelligence and social
constructed expectations
the intelligence tend to be 
rejected
denied
ignored
forget
discredit
reinterpreted


homosapian is generticly predisposed
to abandon reasons for 
comfortable cultural myth
and social narratives

the crowd the study of the popular minds

we have constructed society in which one's position
is based on the possession of automobiles, large
houses, the size of ones' paycheck, and so on so forth
because our self-esteems our status political 
powers depends on those things
we will defend them against all evidence
to do so in long run may be fatal to our
onw interests certainly to the interests of
the community at large

we are in the situation in which these kinds of
social defense mechanisms operate beneath 
consciousness and defeat public policy

the way men live is so far away from the way 
they ought to live
which is to weigh reasons and good governance

rewrite the cultural narrative 
create counter culture
create a cultural institution to suppress behavior
which would otherwise
growth is an juvenle phase in the development

from
competitive individualism
greed
narrow self interest
toward
comminity cooperation
collective interest in surviving

you cannot imagine a world surviving in which
we continue to compete at the individual
and international level for the declining 
resources

you can imagine if learn how cooperate that we
can pull this off

the world is finite
it has a finite capacity to absorb wasted
a finite capacity to produce even renewable
resources
it's also an inequitable world

managing without growth
prosperity without growth

individual and national interest have converged
individual and collective interest have converged
beliefs, values, and assumtions incompatable
with fundamental biophysical context

The collapse of complex society
every act of economic activity involves the
consumption of energy which is permanent
and irreversible

the myth of perpetual growth and technology
to aid and abet that myth
climate change is a waste management problem

co2 is a single largest waste by weight in
the new economic
sustainable prosperity
degrowth
steady state economy
steabilized resource use

Whay No Action?
I'm with stupid.
- Humans are spatial and temporal 'discounters'.
we favour the here and now over other places and
future generations
- Humans are behaviourally conservative. Worse
- This is a new age of unreason, the 21th century
endarkenment

A whole generation has been socially engineered to ignore reality.
'reasoning lie' over 'inconvenient truth'
