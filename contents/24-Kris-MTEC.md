I am a highly ambitious person who is currently completing my IGCSE courses.  I am determined to complete every task I am faced and I often use my critical thinking to explore ways to interpret different topics or jobs I undertake.  My eventual career goal is to be studying or working around the field of material sciences.

Last summer, I came across an interesting and revolutionary device called a super capacitor. A device which could replace batteries for eternity and could potentially revolutionise the world. This triggered a passion interest about material science and would very much like to continue seeking knowledge about semiconductors by studying chemistry and physics throughout my A levels and conducting experiments outside school to further explore my passion.
