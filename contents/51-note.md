Good food is medicine
Bad food needs medicine

CMD (Cronic Metabolic Desease)
Two facts: 1.no medical 2.long treatement

You can't fix healthcare until you fix health
You can't fix health until you fix diet
You can't fix diet until you know what is wrong

2026 : no healthcare
when process food enter => healthcare spending
they have poluted the scientific liturature
they buy scientists

It is difficult to get a man to understand something,
when his salary depends on his not understanding it
1. Role model : UCSF healthy beverage initiatives
2. Type2 diabetes should be renamed Processed food disease
3. Rollback subsidies for processed food (corn wheat soy sugar)
4. Eat real food

The industry is controlling all the science
The only science that is there to battle the industry
is the people like us

processed food is fiberless food
get fiber out we get refined carbohydrate
eat real food we don't need to worry about carb

Glycemic Index
How high is your blood glucose rise when you consume
50g of carb in a specific food
glocose 54 fluctose 19

Glycemic Load
How much you have to eat to get 50g of carb
browning is part of aging
fiber make a gel form scarfold inside ingestine
when you consume food with fiber you mitigated
all those negative effect.
That is called real food.
processed food is fiberless food
then you get it all right away

--- selfish chemical
Endorphin:	mask physical pain then pain later; LOL
Dopamin:	make sure that get stuff done, achievement 
		(visual,target,addictive,destructive,dangerous)
--- social chemical
Serotonin:	leadership cheminal (pride,status) but sacrify
		(reward,ceremony,relationship,money-trik,judge)
Oxytocin:	love, touch, bond of trust, safety, full attention
		(hug,hand-shaking,give-time,premium-time,spend-time-energy)
		(not addictive,take time,generousity)
--- flight or fight chemical
Cortisol:	keep you alive, stress, anxiety, high heart rate

Put God First - Denzel Washington Motivational & Inspiring Commencement Speech
https://youtu.be/BxY_eJLBflk

1. Put got first
Everything you have is a grace of God.
I've been protected,directed, corrected
I kept got in my life. He's kept me humble.
He's been stuck with me. So stick with him in everything you do.
2. Fail Big
Be prepared to fail big to achieve goals
Don't be afraid to be outside of the box.
Dreams without goals are just dreams.
life, yearly, monthly, dayly goals
must apply discipline and consistency
just because you're doing a lot more doesn't mean ...
Make progress
3. You never see a u-haul behind the hearse
Claim your goals, Try hard to get it and help others
It's not about how much money you make, you can't take it with you.
The egyptians tried it, they got robbed.
It's not how much you have, but it's what you do with what you have.
The most selfish thing you can do in this world is help someone help.
You put your slipper under the bed tonight
So that you get up in the morning
You have to get on your knee to reach them
While you're down there say thank you for grace, mercy, understanding
, wisdom, parents, love, kindness, humality, peace, prosperity
Say Thank you in advance for what's already yours
True desire in the heart for anything good that it God proofs to you
sent before hand to indicate that it's yours already.
Go get it.
When you get it reach back, pull someone else up
each one, teach one.
Don't just aspire to make living, aspire to make a difference


The mathematics of weight loss | Ruben Meerman
https://youtu.be/vuIlsN32WaE

Water : H2O
Carbondioxide :	CO2
Fat molecule :	C55H104O6
		C36H724O6

55xCO2 = 55xC + 55xO2
52xH2O = 52xH2 + 52xO
55xO2 + 52xO = (55 + 26)xO2 = (78 + 3)xO2

C55H104O6 + 78xO2 => 55xCO2 + 52xH2O

6CO2 + 6H2O + Sunlight => C6H12O6 glucose

C:12, H:1, O:16
Cx55: 12x55 = 660 kg
Hx104: 1x104 = 104 kg
Ox6: 16x6 = 96 kg
1xFat: 660 + 104 + 96 = 860 kg
78xO2: 78 x 32 = 2496 kg : inhale
Input: 1xFat + 78xO2 = 3356 kg

55xCO2: 55 x 44 = 2420 kg	: 72% : exhale
52xH2O: 52 x 18 = 936 kg 	: 28%
Output: 2420 + 936 = 3356 kg
1xFat + 35xO2 = 12xCO2 + 52xH2O
35x32 = 1120
860 + 1120 = 1980 kg
