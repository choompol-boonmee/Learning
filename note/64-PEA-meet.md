Question 1
Wirote asked;
How much CIM support data model other than grid model ?
For examples human resources, outage work records
, customers, meter, ERP related data model, etc.

I answered;
I will deliver the question to EPRI team.
However when I look into the latest version
of CIM IEC61970-300.
I found all of data model you mentioned.
So I think quite a lot which CIM model can support
around utility data.

================
Question 2
Wirote asked;
I think the our high voltage and voltage model
are the same or similar with other counties so
CIM could be applied relatively easily.
But how about low voltage I think Thai model
may differ from other quite a bit.
May EPRI team focus on Low voltage ?

I answered;
I will deliver the question to EPRI team.

================
Question 3

Sadet asked:
EPRI have a lot of valuable research materials.
Only EPRI member can have access to those materials.
Under this project can we (PEA staff) have access to 
those materials ?
If yes in what extent we can have access ?

I answered:
I will deliver the question to EPRI team.

================
Question 4

Sadet asked:
Among tools recommend by EPRI, Do you also use KANBAN board ?

I answered:
Yes we also use other app together with slack such as
workstream, KANBAN, translater.

================
Question 5

Wirote asked:
In the slide there are templates to fill information about 
who represent what organizational utit to provide info:
... Name, Role, Role in project, Short description.
What do they mean in details.

Pongsakorn suggested:
Randy showed us last week the examples from other utilities.
Dr.Choompol can pick up some of the examples to help
understanding how to fill the form (template).

I answered:
I will retrieve the examples from recorded video last week
which Mr.Pongsakorn mentioned. And share them to help
us understand how fill the form for internal use.

================
Question 6

Wirote asked:
In what part of PEA business this project focus on ?
Focus on planing or operation or maintenance, on
what extent this project will focus ?

I answered:
This focus focus on the whole business.
However which part will be focused more than others
can be adjusted, can be negotiate, can be expected
depending on our will/needs.

================
Question 7

Sadet asked:
In the slide about vendor forum, GMDM vendor forum activity
there are table showing time schedule of this year.
In one item in the table said 'Profile harmonization 
61869-18 and 61970' Is this a typo error or new IEC standard
'61869'

I answered:
I think it is typo error it must be 61968-13.
Your eyes are very sharp.
Thank you for recognize the error.

================
Question 8

Wirote asked:
Among 11 tasks do they have to be done in order
sequencially or can be done parallelly ?
For examples task 8 it sounds to me that it can be done in parallel.
So I can assign a right person in a timely manner.

I answered:
I think the tasks are planned to be executed sequentially
because of dependencies however some tasks may be run
in overlap fashion. 
However I will deliver the question to EPRI team.

================
Question 9

Sadet asked:
Do EPRI specify project management methodology ?
Such as 'waterfall'.

I answered:
I think there is no specific management methodlogy specified.
But we recommend tools for management (slack,workstream,box).
However I will deliver the question to EPRI team.

================
Question 10

Vasitpol asked:
What is 'grid model ?

I answered:
I explained the meaning with various examples for the askers
and also for others have no background about 'Grid'.
(pretty long period)

================
Question 11

Kannika asked:
I don't know much about CIM standard.
Other than define common name and definitions what else CIM can 
be benefitial ?

I answered:
CIM defines common name and meaning for information in order to 
enhance infomation reuse and communication.
CIM cannot do anything by itself 
   but CIM can help doing everything that need to
     share and reuse information among parties.
We can think of CIM as three espects;
1. Common Name: CIM define common name, semantic and attributes of things 
   to help clear/better mutual understanding (More 1500 objects)
2. Profile: To use CIM as common language we have to define/select profile
   or the context of use. We don't have to use all.
   We just need to pick up some of them for specific need. called 'profile'
   There also be popular profile defined by IEC (61970-452,453,456,...)
   We can define a small subset of them to serve our needs.
3. CIM format: In order to allow software to exchange/understand data
   electronically common electronic format is required.
   (61970-552,61968-100 define a standard electronic format for exchange)
